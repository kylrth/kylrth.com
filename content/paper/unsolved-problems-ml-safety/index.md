*This was a paper we presented about in Irina Rish's neural scaling laws course ([IFT6760A](https://sites.google.com/view/towards-agi-course)) in winter 2023. You can view the slides we used [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/11VtXg-sfLkjtIQWXEEEm875esK-8QrNFr09woMYzrV8/edit?usp=sharing), and the recording [here](https://sites.google.com/view/towards-agi-course/schedule#h.lmlkbq72t3iz) (or my backup [here](https://dl.kylrth.com/videos/2023-02-02-ml-safety.mp4)).*
