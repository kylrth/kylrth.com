*I presented this paper in Bang Liu's research group meeting on 2023-07-24. You can view the slides I used [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1w4n4UCWegJlDTCjKqWyTHOb3QHpnz1G2kTV6j_MODqY/edit?usp=sharing).*

It seems like the authors made a mistake that inflated the scores for the multilingual experiments, [according to Ken Schutte](https://kenschutte.com/gzip-knn-paper/).
