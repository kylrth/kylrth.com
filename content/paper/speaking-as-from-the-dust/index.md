I wrote this paper with Stephen Betts, a friend of mine doing Mormon Studies at the University of Virginia. (Click the title to download the preprint.) Our interest in the topic was initially piqued when we stumbled across the [Wilford Woodruff AI Learning Experience](https://wilfordwoodruffpapers.org/wilford-woodruff-ai-learning-experience), and this paper explores the unique intersection of Mormonism, transhumanism, and machine learning that makes such a thing possible.

We're currently looking for a venue to publish this work. **Any feedback on the preprint is appreciated!**
