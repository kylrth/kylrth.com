## tacit knowledge

Saying linguistic differences are just random and uninteresting is like saying architecture around the world doesn't really change.

America has been a melting pot in the sense that it has tried to force people to forget their old languages. (But I think that might just be because so many different kinds of people come that there needs to be a lingua franca.)
Threatened languages carry knowledge about wildlife, geology, weather, and many other things. Much of human knowledge is not scientific, and often not even on the internet. It's too specific and often only shared verbally. This knowledge is the knowledge that has to do with our survival in varied environments.

Here's Hayek as quoted in the book:

> We make constant use of formulas, symbols, and rules whose meaning we do not understand and through the use of which we avail ourselves of the assistance of knowledge which individually we do not possess. We have developed these practices and institutions by building upon habits and institutions which have proved successful in their own sphere and which have in turn become the foundation of the civilization we have built up.

Linguistics has been distracted with phonology and grammar and so it's missed what people actually have to say. Harrison is a "reverse missionary linguist"-- he goes to soak up *their* knowledge and beliefs, and convert to *their* worldview.

Tuva was the first place Harrison went to, and it changed his views on what language was, and how culture is a survival tool. Tuvans have special sounds they make at domesticated animals that make them compliant.

Harrison is dismissive of armchair linguistics because it's just reinterpreting someone else's data.

When we talk about grammar as learned in school, we're really talking about writing style. Actual grammar is tacit knowledge, meaning that we know it, but we don't know we know it and we can't really articulate it.

Languages animate objects by giving them names, making them noticeable when we might not otherwise be aware of them. For example, Tuvan has a word for the short side of a hill. The lexicon affects perception and thought, and we don't know by how much. We need to study languages in their natural habitats to understand this effect. The word for "go" in Tuvan is highly conditional on geography and awareness of the locations of others. Tuvans always know where relatives and friends are and will be.

Folk taxonomies (like classifying yaks by colors and patterns) are how languages build up knowledge of how the world interacts with humans.

Studying the rare languages plays an outsized role in helping us understand what a language can be.

## linguistic determinism and linguistic relativity

If there's only one speaker left, a language effectively does not exist because there's no conversation. And no one person knows all of English or any other language. A language evolves across the minds of those who speak it. So it's hard to say that the thing called "English" can be expressed as a lexicon and a set of rules operating over it.

(I think our culture seems to view individuals as the ultimate actors who are free to choose their lives as they please, but other cultures, including our past ones, give people more rigid roles. Maybe ours is not necessarily better, just different.)

The strong form of linguistic determinism has been discredited (i.e. language does not limit what we think or can say). The weak form (linguistic relativity) says language influences our experience of reality, and this is probably true. Instead of thinking of language as a kind of blinder that prevents us from seeing or saying certain things, we can think of it as a magnifying glass that focuses our attention, requiring us to pay attention to certain details. So, for a Tuvan speaker, because he must know the direction of the river current in order to say "go," the language is forcing him to pay attention to river flow and to be aware of it at all times.

Linguists make fun of "There are x words for y in z language", but the reality is that languages can "[encode] all this knowledge in complex ways in hundreds of specialized and highly descriptive words."

I think Harrison is too quick to find value in all the specialized words in all the languages. When he's talking about knowledge embedded in these languages, what he's really talking about is cultural knowledge that can be shared in any language, albeit not as easily.

## indigenous rights

The case of the Mapuche people sueing Microsoft for making a Mapudungun version of Windows is interesting. At first, it seems silly for a cultural institution (even indigenous) to say who can and can't use the language. But two things made me think otherwise:

1. The Mapuche people were not consulted in the process.
1. They were introducing a new orthography for the language.

We need to respect the way indigenous groups want to protect and share their language.

Kallawaya is a language invented specifically to store the knowledge of medicinal plants. Harrison argues they have the right to protect their knowledge by keeping their language a secret.

## language hotspots

The idea of a biodiversity hotspot or language hotspot communicates how the species and language density varies dramatically across the world.

Northern Australia is the top hotspot both in diversity and endangerment.

Indigenous people have a connection to the land that is almost impossible for a world traveler or a member of a colonial culture to understand.

One man from the Ishir people in Bolivia who's about 85 remembers pre-contact and post-contact life. What a ride from hunter-gatherer society to airplanes, motorboats, and cell phones in a single lifetime.

Some languages are thriving against odds, often due to cultural pride and tight-knit community. There's even the Maka language spoken by a small group right in the middle of Asunci√≥n, Paraguay.

A hidden language is one that's known only locally and don't show up on official records. Koro has had stability despite so few speakers because people choose to speak it. They do not accommodate when someone else knows it.

Harrison considers language features to be a technology.

We must not "exoticize" groups, but describe them as they see themselves.
