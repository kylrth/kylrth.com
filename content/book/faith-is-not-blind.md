Elder Hafen struggled as a missionary with the concept of knowing versus believing: he felt he believed it was true, but not that he knew it. On the mission he felt pressure to bear testimony with the word "know", but he chafed at that. In this book, Elder Hafen hopes to discuss the complex boundaries between believing and knowing, Richard Bushman, a prominent LDS historian, found himself in a similar situation. He felt that he didn't have the right words to express his belief in the nuanced way that he needed, even though looking back he thinks he *did* believe. This makes me look forward to reading Bushman's "Rough Stone Rolling", to try to understand his language of faith.

Hafen argues that life is full of ambiguity because we have greater access to information and opinion than ever before. That, and people tend to like being certain more than being right, so the voices at the extremes are often louder.

It's important to feel the discomfort caused by the ambiguity; if you don't, your faith is untested and na√Øve. But the ability to acknowledge ambiguity is not the final goal of faith development. It has simply asked the right kinds of questions. Hafen believes the goal is to reach a third stage, where we acknowledge the difficult questions but choose to act in faith despite not having the answers.

Chesterton expressed this trichotomy using the terms "optimists", "pessimists", and "improvers". (I think that for a long time the church has actively created a culture of optimists, while there is some movement now to acknowledge the difficulties. It has often been about the "front-bench official answer to all attacks", as Chesterton puts it.) To Chesterton, the problem with the pessimists isn't that they see the problems but that they don't love the human condition enough to try to fix them. Improvers acknowledge imperfection but love enough to try to help.

At one point Hafen refers to the three stages as "simplicity", "complexity", and "settled simplicity". Later he uses the metaphor from Alma 32, referring to stage two as a moment of hot sun that has the potential to wither the plant. He says that our plant can survive the complexity through a "tough but trusting process of refinement" that brings the real and the ideal closer together.
