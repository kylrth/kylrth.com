Elder Hafen struggled as a missionary with the concept of knowing versus believing: he felt he believed it was true, but not that he knew it. On the mission he felt pressure to bear testimony with the word "know", but he chafed at that. In this book, Elder Hafen hopes to discuss the complex boundaries between believing and knowing, Richard Bushman, a prominent LDS historian, found himself in a similar situation. He felt that he didn't have the right words to express his belief in the nuanced way that he needed, even though looking back he thinks he *did* believe. This makes me look forward to reading Bushman's "Rough Stone Rolling", to try to understand his language of faith.
