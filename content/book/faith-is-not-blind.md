Elder Hafen struggled as a missionary with the concept of knowing versus believing: he felt he believed it was true, but not that he knew it. On the mission he felt pressure to bear testimony with the word "know", but he chafed at that. In this book, Elder Hafen hopes to discuss the complex boundaries between believing and knowing, Richard Bushman, a prominent LDS historian, found himself in a similar situation. He felt that he didn't have the right words to express his belief in the nuanced way that he needed, even though looking back he thinks he *did* believe. This makes me look forward to reading Bushman's "Rough Stone Rolling", to try to understand his language of faith.

Hafen argues that life is full of ambiguity because we have greater access to information and opinion than ever before. That, and people tend to like being certain more than being right, so the voices at the extremes are often louder.

## the three stages

It's important to feel the discomfort caused by the ambiguity; if you don't, your faith is untested and na√Øve. But the ability to acknowledge ambiguity is not the final goal of faith development. It has simply asked the right kinds of questions. Hafen believes the goal is to reach a third stage, where we acknowledge the difficult questions but choose to act in faith despite not having the answers.

Chesterton expressed this trichotomy using the terms "optimists", "pessimists", and "improvers". (I think that for a long time the church has actively created a culture of optimists, while there is some movement now to acknowledge the difficulties. It has often been about the "front-bench official answer to all attacks", as Chesterton puts it.) To Chesterton, the problem with the pessimists isn't that they see the problems but that they don't love the human condition enough to try to fix them. Improvers acknowledge imperfection but love enough to try to help.

At one point Hafen refers to the three stages as "simplicity", "complexity", and "settled simplicity". Later he uses the metaphor from Alma 32, referring to stage two as a moment of hot sun that has the potential to wither the plant. He says that our plant can survive the complexity through a "tough but trusting process of refinement" that brings the real and the ideal closer together.

## dealing with complexity in the internet age

Because of the internet, it is more likely than ever that believing members will encounter complexity in the church's historical narrative and doctrine. Hafen says we need to teach our kids how to encounter this kind of complexity, so that it doesn't surprise them into shifting the burden of proof of being right onto the church. Openly discussion things like the gospel topics essays can help with that. Hafen says it's not the church's fault that people stay in stage one sometimes, but I think I disagree. For a very long time there has been a culture of not questioning. Past church leaders have cast shame on those who doubt. I remember that when I was growing up I was taught to avoid anti-Mormon literature as if it were spiritual pornography. This is certainly a cultural thing, but it's been strengthened by the actions and teachings of the leaders of the church.

He says of stage three, "we won't let the issues we don't yet understand get in the way of the fundamental truths we do understand". I think that when I first encountered this material I was sort of surprised into disbelief. I hadn't really discovered definitive proof that the church wasn't true, I just suddenly realized how likely it was and so I stopped believing. I probably shouldn't have been so hasty. People who encounter these issues are quick to say that they understand the issues more than people on level one, but knowing about the issues isn't the same as truly understanding them. I think that's why I feel so driven to really get to the bottom of the issues I'm facing by reading as much as I can from both sides and finding primary sources.

I also need to try my best to maintain my desires to keep the commandments, so that I don't get distracted by anything that would make me not *want* to stay. I've really loved the teachings of the church in the past, and that's a useful fact to keep my motivations fair.

Hafen argues that the amazing doctrinal truths restored through Joseph Smith are much more important than the method by which he did it. I think this downplays the importance of determining the truth carefully, and oversells the doctrine. Yes, there are some very distinct doctrinal teachings that are pretty unique, but it's easy to see how they could have stemmed from the religious trends of Joseph's day. To argue that those concerned with the specifics of the Restoration are missing the point is to argue that doctrine that "rings true" is more important than truth. One important point he makes is the possibility that we won't understand the method by which God revealed the truth to Joseph. If that's the case, it's still valid to try as hard as we can to understand it based on the history we have.

I need to try to be more meek in my prayers, and acknowledge my imperfect ability to determine truth by myself. I've struggled to be as open in my prayers because I've stopped believing that anyone is listening.

The Hafens argue that part of moving to stage three is being willing to simply accept plausible explanations as a part of trusting the Lord enough to leave it to him. Am I willing to accept plausible explanations? I think that I am as long as they are actually plausible. So for example it's plausible that the Book of Mormon was translated by some other method than reading exact words off of the seer stone, despite the fact that people said that's what he did. But I'm not willing to accept that tapirs were the horses of the Book of Mormon, for example. That's not plausible *given how horses were used in the Book of Mormon (i.e. with chariots and for travel)*.

I think I need to work harder to give the church the benefit of the doubt. I'm not willing to accept implausible explanations for problems, but I am willing to accept plausible ones.
