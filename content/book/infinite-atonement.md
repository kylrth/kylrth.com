*These notes are made while reading this with a Mormon theological background, so I skip noting some of the basic Mormon doctrines about the Atonement that he teaches.*

The Atonement is the central doctrine of Christianity. All scripture should be at least partially focused on it, and we're invited to "speak of the atonement of Christ, and attain to a perfect knowledge of him" (Jacob 4:12).

## What is the significance of the Atonement?

Here are some of the ways that we come to understand the Atonement:

- Refining our "cultural sensitivities" allows us to approach the Atonement with a more heart-felt empathy for the tenderness and compassion it represents.
- Sacrificing our lives in service allows us to stand in awe of His eternal sacrifice.
- Perfecting our powers of reason will get a greater understanding of the "'whys' and 'hows'" of the Atonement.
- Living a pure and clean life will give us greater kinship with Jesus, who we are emulating in a small way.

Leaving it up to just one of these doesn't do it justice. There is no singular pattern for understanding the Atonement.

The Atonement is the single event that provides meaning for all other events. Without it, any invention, discovery, movement, or decision is just particles interacting in a fallen universe.

Nothing else Jesus did in his life is as important, and no other aspect of the gospel is interesting without the fact of the Atonement. "The Atonement is our singular hope for a meaningful life."

## Why study the Atonement?

BH Roberts noted that after studying the Atonement he felt an "intellectual conversion" to it. The topic of the Atonement has not been approached directly in other Christian faiths like it has by the Book of Mormon and this church. Understanding the Atonement motivates us to appreciate it's blessings.

## Can we fully comprehend the Atonement?

We make attempts to understand all the whys and hows, but we won't be able to grasp it all. But that's not good enough reason to deny the effects of the Atonement. (We may not be able to conceptualize particle-wave duality but we can describe its effects.) We have to ask God for help to understand it, and not harden our hearts in disbelief.

## What are the purposes of the atonement?

- make us one with God in location
- make us one with God in quality and identity

Just as we are to become one with God in state and likeness, he became like us in state and likeness (mortality) "without ever abandoning his godlike character". The Atonement can be symbolized by an embrace, and the promise is that there will be an actual embrace at the gate to heaven. Elder Maxwell thinks the reason Christ "employs no servant there" (2 Nephi 9:41) is because he wants to personally welcome us. (I don't think that's what Nephi was getting at, but it could still be true.)

To really grasp the atonement we need to believe that all need to be saved from personal sin.

*My question: why does the Fall imply that we will all sin?*

To attempt a mastery of the Atonement without first comprehending the Fall would be tantamount to confronting geometry without a grasp of basic algebraic principles. *(Note: this is funny because studying geometry doesn't require algebra, but I get his point.)*

*My question: was it really a choice to eat the apple if they were in a state of "spiritual sterility" without temptations or obstacles?*

Callister thinks maybe the conflict of commandments in the garden was necessary so that man could not claim God forced him to accept the responsibility of mortality. But wasn't that the point of choosing to accept the plan in heaven? What about the feelings of everyone else besides Adam and Eve on the matter? It had to be a choice to fall into mortality, "in apparent opposition to God's command". I don't think this makes a ton of sense. It feels like a formality at no one's request.
