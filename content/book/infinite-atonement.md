The Atonement is the central doctrine of Christianity. All scripture should be at least partially focused on it, and we're invited to "speak of the atonement of Christ, and attain to a perfect knowledge of him" (Jacob 4:12).

## What is the significance of the Atonement?

Here are some of the ways that we come to understand the Atonement:

- Refining our "cultural sensitivities" allows us to approach the Atonement with a more heart-felt empathy for the tenderness and compassion it represents.
- Sacrificing our lives in service allows us to stand in awe of His eternal sacrifice.
- Perfecting our powers of reason will get a greater understanding of the "'whys' and 'hows'" of the Atonement.
- Living a pure and clean life will give us greater kinship with Jesus, who we are emulating in a small way.

Leaving it up to just one of these doesn't do it justice. There is no singular pattern for understanding the Atonement.

The Atonement is the single event that provides meaning for all other events. Without it, any invention, discovery, movement, or decision is just particles interacting in a fallen universe.
