*These notes are made while reading this with a Mormon theological background, so I skip noting some of the basic Mormon doctrines about the Atonement that he teaches.*

The Atonement is the central doctrine of Christianity. All scripture should be at least partially focused on it, and we're invited to "speak of the atonement of Christ, and attain to a perfect knowledge of him" (Jacob 4:12).

## What is the significance of the Atonement?

Here are some of the ways that we come to understand the Atonement:

- Refining our "cultural sensitivities" allows us to approach the Atonement with a more heart-felt empathy for the tenderness and compassion it represents.
- Sacrificing our lives in service allows us to stand in awe of His eternal sacrifice.
- Perfecting our powers of reason will get a greater understanding of the "'whys' and 'hows'" of the Atonement.
- Living a pure and clean life will give us greater kinship with Jesus, who we are emulating in a small way.

Leaving it up to just one of these doesn't do it justice. There is no singular pattern for understanding the Atonement.

The Atonement is the single event that provides meaning for all other events. Without it, any invention, discovery, movement, or decision is just particles interacting in a fallen universe.

Nothing else Jesus did in his life is as important, and no other aspect of the gospel is interesting without the fact of the Atonement. "The Atonement is our singular hope for a meaningful life."

## Why study the Atonement?

BH Roberts noted that after studying the Atonement he felt an "intellectual conversion" to it. The topic of the Atonement has not been approached directly in other Christian faiths like it has by the Book of Mormon and this church. Understanding the Atonement motivates us to appreciate it's blessings.

## Can we fully comprehend the Atonement?

We make attempts to understand all the whys and hows, but we won't be able to grasp it all. But that's not good enough reason to deny the effects of the Atonement. (We may not be able to conceptualize particle-wave duality but we can describe its effects.) We have to ask God for help to understand it, and not harden our hearts in disbelief.

## What are the purposes of the atonement?

- make us one with God in location
- make us one with God in quality and identity

Just as we are to become one with God in state and likeness, he became like us in state and likeness (mortality) "without ever abandoning his godlike character". The Atonement can be symbolized by an embrace, and the promise is that there will be an actual embrace at the gate to heaven. Elder Maxwell thinks the reason Christ "employs no servant there" (2 Nephi 9:41) is because he wants to personally welcome us. (I don't think that's what Nephi was getting at, but it could still be true.)

## the Fall of Adam

To really grasp the Atonement we need to believe that all need to be saved from personal sin.

*My question: why does the Fall imply that we will all sin?*

To attempt a mastery of the Atonement without first comprehending the Fall would be tantamount to confronting geometry without a grasp of basic algebraic principles. *(This is funny because studying geometry doesn't require algebra, but I get his point.)*

*My question: was it really a choice to eat the apple if they were in a state of "spiritual sterility" without temptations or obstacles?*

Callister thinks maybe the conflict of commandments in the garden was necessary so that man could not claim God forced him to accept the responsibility of mortality. But wasn't that the point of choosing to accept the plan in heaven? What about the feelings of everyone else besides Adam and Eve on the matter? It had to be a choice to fall into mortality, "in apparent opposition to God's command". I don't think this makes a ton of sense. It feels like a formality at no one's request.

## the relationship between the Fall and the Atonement

The Atonement overcomes the first spiritual death by returning us to God to be judged, and also overcomes the second spiritual death (for those who repent) by cleansing us of our sins. This distinction is important because the Atonement must have saved us from *all* the consequences of the Fall.

In Mormon theology there are four kinds of "saved":

1. We are all **saved** from physical death because we will all be resurrected.
1. All but the sons of perdition are **saved** from the "power and dominion of Satan" because we will end up in one of the three kingdoms of glory.
1. Those who inherit the celestial kingdom are "**saved** in the sense that they are not banished from the Father's presence.
1. Those who are exalted are **saved** from "every form of damnation" because they are entitled to eternal increase and become like God himself. Elder McConkie taught that most scriptural references to salvation actually refer to exaltation.

## the consequences if there had been no Atonement

Brigham Young taught that the Atonement was necessary in order for us to reach any kingdom of glory. Without the Atonement, the plan of coming to Earth and then returning to God in any sense would have failed. Here Callister tries to threaten us with the thought that if life ends then it has no meaning.

## the infinite nature of the Atonement

The Atonement is infinite because it was performed by a God who is infinite, but B H Roberts also thought that the word "infinite" was used "to express the idea of the sufficiency of [the Atonement]; its completeness; the universality and power of it," (p. 59).

### infinite in power

In the scriptures we hear about Christ receiving "all power ... in heaven and in earth" (Matthew 28:18). Callister believes that Christ's life and atonement were a chance for his divine attributes to act in such a benevolent way that he gained the power necessary to save us (in all the forms of salvation discussed above). He did not have that power before performing these acts.

### infinite in time

The scriptures promise that the Atonement applies retroactively (Ether 3:13; Mosiah 3:13). Callister explains that this is possible because God (and all of humanity) trusted Jesus' credibility when he promised to perform the Atonement. "This is why the laws of justice could recognize the benefits of the Atonement *before* the purchase price was ever paid, because his promise, his pledge, his credit was 'good for it,' and everone who honored their first estate knew it," (p. 74). And we know full well that Jehovah/Christ does not break his covenants (D&C 58:31; Numbers 23:19; 1 Kings 7:56; Abraham 3:17; Nehemiah 9:32).

Callister suggests that the Atonement covers even the sins we committed in our premortal life. The statement that "no unclean thing can dwell with God" appears to be true only in the context of post-judgment life, and we're also told that people were more or less valiant in the premortal life (see Alma 13), which implies that people were not perfect then. *(If this is true, my question is this: if Adam and Eve had been sinning since their spirits were created, what's so special about their first mortal transgression that caused them to fall from the presence of God at that point?)* D&C 93:38 seems to confirm that, for those of us who "kept our first estate" and were born into this world, the Atonement has redeemed us from the sins of that first estate as a part of redeeming us from the Fall.

While the Atonement is infinite in time, Callister is clear to point out that "the time for repentance is not," (p. 81).

### infinite in coverage

The Atonement saves all plants, animals, and even this planet from physical death (no salvation from spiritual death necessary). The Atonement saves all the people in the whole universe, in all the worlds God created. It was performed here on this planet, possibly because this planet was the most wicked (Moses 7:36), because Israel was a nation that would crucify their God (2 Nephi 10:3), or because here God could find the full range of people from best to worst to witness and reject/accept the Atonement.

### infinite in depth

The Atonement involved taking on all forms of human suffering:

- suffering caused by sin, even for those who do not repent
  - Here Callister explains that those who deny the Holy Ghost cannot be forgiven because they have chosen to reject the Atonement. But why does that leave them with no chance for repentance afterward? It does seem like this action is not covered.
  - I think Callister succinctly explained an important component of how Mormons solve the problem of evil: "true omnipotence is being able to do anything, anytime, anyplace *within the confines of the inexorable laws of justice*," (p. 100).
  - Here's a great example of circular reasoning: "The Atonement of the Savior covers every repentable sin known to man," (p. 101). Of course "the Atonement cannot ... exalt anyone who has ... irreversibly closed the doors of repentance" (p. 102) because the Atonement defines the terms of repentance! The only reasons denying the Holy Ghost cannot be forgiven are that either the person never repented afterward or the Atonement doesn't cover it.
- suffering from innocent transgression
- suffering due to trials that have nothing to do with transgression
- suffering due to confronting temptation
- suffering due to the exercise of faith
  - Callister argues that because Jesus did not have full omnipotence while on Earth (see Luke 2:52), there were times when he had to trust the Father against his reason (see for example Matthew 26:39). Because of this, Jesus understands what it's like to have to exercise faith in God without a sure knowledge.

### infinite in suffering

Jesus suffered the Atonement as a man, not as a God. "He took not on him the nature of angels; but he took on him the seed of Abraham," (Hebrews 2:16-17). Callister thinks that Jesus only used his godlike powers to keep from going unconscious or dying.

There is no good explanation for why Jesus' blood had to be shed in addition to suffering the pain of the Atonement. There's a lot of symbolic metaphor that can be taught with it, but no real reason for it.

Callister, McConkie, and others believe that the strengthening angel might have been Adam, mostly for symbolic reasons.

Callister thinks there were more cataclysmic signs of Christ's death in the New World to compensate for not being able to witness the actual event. "Those lands where the Savior's physical presence was absent no doubt responded with more powerful elemental reactions as a compensating witness," (p. 126). Nice symbolism, but the potency of the events in the Lehite lands around the Savior's death is not matched by anything else in recorded history in any other land far from Jerusalem.

The Savior's experience of the effects of sin would have been more difficult for him because he had never sinned or felt guilt in his life up until that point, and because he could feel that his people (the world) loved darkness rather than light. The fact that he knew more and cared more meant that he suffered more. And the scriptures and prophets point out that this wasn't a passive suffering; he actively "broke the bands of death" and had to contend with Satan.

Next Callister discusses the concept of a personal atonement, where Christ suffered for the sins and death of each of us individually. There's actually less canonized scriptural backing for this idea than I thought; the idea is drawn through analogy from Isaiah 53:10, 3 Nephi 11:15, and 3 Nephi 17:21. But several modern writers (including President Heber Grant) have described the individualness of the Atonement, and it seems to make sense in light of other prophets' visions of all the souls of humanity (Moses 1:28; Ether 3:25).

Christ suffered the withdrawal of the Father's presence in order to fully experience what we experience when we sin (see Mosiah 2:36) and to pay the price of sin completely by his own power (see Isaiah 63:3, 5). Callister points out that Joseph Smith experienced a small degree of the withdrawal of the Spirit when the 116 pages were lost, and that day was terrible for everyone in the house. Callister draws a comparison with that story to illustrate the intensity of Jesus' experiencing the full measure of separation from God.

Callister offers four possible explanations for why Jesus' suffering could fit into so finite a period:

- God doesn't experience time the way we do (D&C 38:2).
- Jesus could squeeze more suffering into a moment of time than anyone else can.
- Jesus suffered the pain of anticipation ever since he promised to perform the Atonement.
- Jesus suffers for the sins of the world any time he observes them, into the future. "Giving life costs God something as it costs us something," as BH Roberts said (p. 150).

Callister points out that Jesus knew exactly what was in store for him before performing the Atonement. If he had submitted without full recognition, it would not have been an agentic action. Still, despite his perfect intellectual understanding of the event, he could not have fully comprehended the *experience* of the Atonement, just as we don't really understand falling in love until it happens to us.
