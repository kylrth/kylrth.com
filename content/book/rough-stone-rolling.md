*I'm reading this book at the same time as* [No man knows my history: the life of Joseph Smith]({{< relref "no-man-knows.md" >}}) *by Fawn Brodie, and I'm comparing what the two cover. Interesting things that appear in both books might be covered here or there.*

*I appreciate that when Bushman leaves out a primary source, he usually explains why that's a reasonable thing to do (as with the Hurlbut affidavits or Ingersoll's testimony). I also appreciate the detail with which Bushman compares Joseph's theology with the doctrines of other religious groups of the period. It gives me a good context to understand the innovations Joseph actually brought.*

## preface

> A believing historian like myself cannot hope to rise above these battles or pretend nothing personal is at stake. For a character as controversial as Smith, pure objectivity is impossible. What I can do is look frankly at all sides of Joseph Smith, facing up to his mistakes and flaws. (Preface)

Bushman's goal here is to get into the mind of Joseph Smith, and for that he needs "to think as Smith thought and to reconstruct the beliefs of his followers as they understood them." We have to take at face value the fact that Joseph felt his life was guided by these specifically revealed words from God.

## chapter 1

This chapter explains the lives of Joseph's grandparents and parents, as well as the events leading up to the family settling in Palmyra. Sadly, the Smiths and the Macks had attained land ownership and reasonable wealth but Joseph Sr. and Lucy lost theirs due to unfortunate financial dealings. This was what caused the family to have to move so frequently.

It was also interesting to hear about the religious heritage that Joseph Jr. received. His paternal grandfather was a Universalist, his other grandfather had an evangelical conversion at the end of his life, and his father wanted religion but distrusted the institutions of religion that he encountered. Meanwhile his mother was frustrated by her husband's lack of interest in institutional religion and desperately wanted to find a church that met her desires.

## chapter 2

Bushman notes that after his visit with the angel Moroni Joseph brought the religious unification the Smith family had been seeking. According to Brodie, Joseph's mother and several siblings stopped attending the Methodist church a year later in September 1828, so this fits together.

While Brodie focuses her description on the money-digging practices of Joseph and his family, Bushman demonstrates that there are likely just as many stories of money-digging among their neighbors. It was interesting to learn that when a group searched the Smith home for the plates, they brought the neighbor Sally Chase who had a "green glass, through which she could see many very wonderful things." William Chase, her older brother, was "the most vigorous of the Manchester treasure-seekers" and also a Methodist class leader. It's clear that treasure seeking was an important part of the culture surrounding Joseph, even for religious people.

The Smiths apparently believed in rod and stone divining, the astrology found in the almanacs published in their day, and magical parchments that were later passed down through the Hyrum Smith family.

Several accounts agree that Joseph found the plates using his seer stone, so it makes sense that the first time Joseph tried to retrieve the plates, he had in mind the idea to make money with them. Bushman argues that Moroni's instructions "connected the greed of the money-digger with the powers of Satan", and so it may have been that the four years spent trying to obtain the plates were to help Joseph "purge himself of his treasure-seeking greed." (According to [this article](https://www.jstor.org/stable/45225965?seq=16#metadata_info_tab_contents)) by Dan Vogel, Joseph had engaged in digging on the Hill Cumorah with others during the years leading up to his receiving the plates.)

Joseph told Alva Hale that "the 'gift in seeing with a stone' was 'a gift from God' but that '*peeping* was all damned nonsense'." Bushman interprets this to argue that Joseph was shifting away from "glass-looking" and toward the divine role of a seer. Bushman doesn't trust the account of Peter Ingersoll when he says that "Joseph acknowledged [to Isaac Hale] that 'he could not see in a stone now, nor never could.'" Bushman points out that Joseph never said anything like this at any other time, and I would add that it would be easy for Ingersoll to sum up Joseph's repudiation of glass-looking as a repudiation of his stone.

## chapter 3

Bushman points out that one thing all close accounts have in common is physical references to the plates Joseph was translating. Brodie points to a story of Joseph filling his frock with sand and saying it was the plates. Vogel thinks there might have been tin plates. Contemporaries thought he might have wrapped a tile brick in a cloth.

Bushman feels that "hunting for deception" misses the point. The point is that people believed Joseph, by the thousands.

Martin Harris was initially skeptical, and asked the story of each Smith family member individually to check for contradictions. He hefted the box containing the plates, and went home. When he prayed that night, the still small voice confirmed to him that it was true.

Several primary sources indicate that Harris went to New York City with the intention of getting the characters translated. It sounds like they thought if they could get translations for a majority of the characters they could continue by himself. But what Harris did was ask if the translation was correct. In Anthon's 1834 account, he denies giving Harris a written opinion, but in 1841 he gave a written opinion that the characters were false, in an attempt to expose the fraud.

Bushman states that the characters are identifiably Egyptian, but he doesn't seem to have a source for this. We don't even have the actual Anthon transcript, because the "Charactors" document was produced later than Harris's trip and doesn't match Anthon's description. Harris says Anthon certified that "the characters were Egyptian, Chaldaic, Assyriac, and Arabic", which makes very little sense.

Joseph didn't refer to the Aaronic Priesthood restoration (set in 1829) until 1832, and then only barely. The story got into its final state in 1838. Bushman explains this (along with Joseph's phased introduction of the First Vision) as evidence that Joseph was careful about revealing divine manifestations to others. But he was often so quickly willing to share revelations (received through the stone or otherwise) that I doubt this explanation. It does seem that by 1834 this event was common knowledge, because Cowdery reveled in his experience in a church newspaper.

To Brodie's retelling of times when Joseph couldn't translate, Bushman adds that in a particular case it was because of being angry with Emma that Joseph had to pray and repent before returning to the work.

Bushman tells the story of receiving the ordination to elder as a separate occurrence from the appearance of Peter, James, and John to bestow keys of Apostleship, and without any angels appearing.

I've heard mention of Joseph trying to sell the copyright to the Book of Mormon in Canada, but never had read enough information. Here's Bushman's account:

> The alarmed inhabitants of "the surrounding country" resolved never to purchase the Book of Mormon and tried to persuade Grandin [the publisher] to stop publication. They argued that since the Smiths had lost their farm they could not pay him unless the book sold, and they were not buying. Having entered the contract reluctantly in the first place, Grandin stopped work until he could be assured of payment. In an attempt to start the presses again, Harris consented to sell part of his farm to raise some cash, although only after getting a signed agreement from Joseph Sr. giving Harris the right to sell books on his own account. Impatient with Harris's reluctance, Hyrum urged Joseph to leave him out entirely and raise the money by other means. Hyrum had heard that the copyright could be sold in Canada and asked Joseph to inquire of the Lord. David Whitmer later reported that Joseph told Cowdery and Hiram Page to go to Toronto and promised them success, but the two returned empty-handed. They had to depend on Harris after all.

## chapter 4

Bushman points out that many consider the Book of Mormon overly simple and boring, while others see great depth and extract a lot of meaning, though that generally falls along church membership lines.

In Bushman's section on criticisms of the Book of Mormon, he mentions that apologists defend the lack of horse artifacts in America by pointing out that there's no archaeological evidence of the Huns using horses either. I think this bothers me in particular because the horse issue is to me a strong evidence of 19th century authorship. So I did some reading on Wikipedia. A few things:

- The Huns were nomadic, which meant they did not congregate in large numbers like agrarian societies do.
- The Huns were never as large in population as the Lehites were said to be in the Book of Mormon.

Bushman says it's unlikely that the Smith family spent any time musing about the origin of the Indians, but then talks at length about the various theories passed around for the origin. It is interesting to hear evidence that the Lost Tribes theory was not the most popular of the origin theories.

*View of the Hebrews* is sort of a summary of the Israelite origin theory. Bushman discredits *View of the Hebrews* as a source document for the Book of Mormon because it's purpose is different. This sidesteps the problem, rather than addressing the fact that *View of the Hebrews* includes a story of Israelites coming to America by boat and splitting into two groups (one civilized and the other savage), with the savage civilization eventually destroying the civilized.

One of Bushman's stronger points is that the Book of Mormon does not contain the obvious references to Indian culture that you might expect, like corn, tepees, braves, or feathers. But he does admit that the Book of Mormon refers to the Lamanites as blood-thirsty and bare-chested, pointing out that the Book of Mormon view of the Lamanites is similar to the Jacksonian view of Indians common to most Americans in 1830.

Bushman allays criticisms of racism in the Book of Mormon by mentioning that the Indians are God's chosen people descended from Israelites, more chosen than the European Gentiles settling America who God requires to help the Indians.

I really enjoyed Bushman's discussion of how the Book of Mormon interprets the Bible. "The Jews have their revelations in Palestine, the Nephites have theirs in the Western Hemisphere. Beyond these two, all the tribes of Israel produce bibles, each containing its own revelation: [cites 2 Nephi 29:12] ... Every nation will receive it's measure of revelation: [cites Alma 29:8]. The tiny land of Palestine does not begin to encompass the revelation flooding the earth. Biblical revelation is generalized to the whole world. All peoples have their epic stories and their sacred books. ... The world is a hive of bible-making."

## chapter 5

The first coverts to the church were often visionaries or seekers, because the offer of new revelation enticed them.

The first persecution that Mormons experienced was after the baptism of several members of the Knight family. They were followed back from the baptism by a mob, and then Joseph was charged with being a disorderly person, likely trying to draw from the past charges over money digging.

At the beginning of the church, Joseph received a revelation to get his support from the church, but also to plant his fields.

While Joseph had stopped using a seer stone after completing the Book of Mormon, Hiram Page started receiving revelations through a stone and David Whitmer thought that was important. Joseph very early on had to correct for this (as well as some changes Cowdery wanted to make to the Articles of the church) and establish the kind of authority the prophet's revelations were going to have. This quick action united the group under Joseph's authority and marked the new movement as a church rather than a charismatic sect.

After establishing the church, the next task was to preach to the Indians and set up a site for a temple for New Jerusalem.

I had no idea that Rigdon was baptized in Ohio while Cowdery was on his way to Missouri, and then Joseph's whole church moved to Ohio after persecution increased in New York.

## chapter 6

Joseph's revelations differed from those of other prophets in the period because they spoke directly as God without intermediary, they were considered equivalent to scripture, and Joseph's followers regarded them much higher than Joseph's own voice. Joseph dictated the revelations (commandments) in much the same way as the Book of Mormon: slowly, out loud, and without hesitation or review.

Joseph's project of the Bible translation demonstrates his extreme confidence as a prophet at that point.

I had no idea Joseph had gotten started on the Book of Moses so soon after the creation of the church.

The major themes of the Book of Moses were these:

- The full Gospel has been around since the beginning of time, rather than being gradually revealed until Jesus came and finished it.
- Prophethood is an ordeal, a battle between forces of good and evil.
- Moses 1:39
- The theme of cosmic inquiry would continue to play a role in Joseph's prophethood.
- apocalypse (in the section on Enoch)
- sorrow for the sins of the world
- linking latter-day history with biblical history (through Zion)

Joseph's expansion on the story of Enoch was happening just as "a vast apocryphal literature on Enoch was first being rediscovered," but it's unlikely Joseph knew about the Ethiopic text in time. The two are only similar in that they make references to the Son of Man and other New Testament titles for Christ.

Joseph identified with Enoch the most. He used the name as a pseudonym later in life.

## chapter 7

Visionaries were an important part of American religion since before the American revolution. The Freewill Baptists, the Universalists, and the Shakers all "had their 'ultimate source' in 'the charismatic, visionary experience of prophetic leaders.'" Even Methodism, the fastest-growing sect of the time, was initialy basically supported by stories of visions and dreams, despite later efforts to "tam[e] extravagant impulses".

The Campbellites, from which several Kirtland converts had come, were focused on reforming the church back to its original form and structure. Walter Scott, a Campbellite, "reduced the Gospel to five simple points: faith, repentance, baptism by immersion, remission of sins, and the gift of the Holy Spirit." Sound familiar?

The visionary impulse of the first Mormons in Kirtland attracted many people to the faith, but it began to get out of hand after the New York missionaries continued on to Missouri. When Joseph arrived, he couldn't just tell them all they were false visions. So instead he made clear that he was the only person responsible to receive revelation from God. After the visions continued, a second revelation clarified that the focus should be on the "spirit of truth", rather than "spiritual exhilaration". Visions should be for knowledge.

Even though the word "priesthood" is mentioned in the Book of Mormon, Joseph didn't use the word in his preaching for several years, until the meeting where he ordained several people to the high priesthood. This makes sense because New England Christians chaffed at the word as a symbol of the hierarchy of the Roman Catholic church. ("David Whitmer blamed the introduction of the priesthood on Sidney Rigdon," says a footnote.) Before this moment, people were called to church offices and given authority without mention of the specific word "priesthood". At this meeting, everyone (including Joseph Smith and people who were already ordained Elders) received the "high priesthood", the Melchisedec Priesthood. Bushman says it's pretty unmistakable that they mean the Melchisedec Priesthood and not the office of high priest. This means that at this time the ideas about priesthood offices and authority were still being formed.

Priesthood is essential to Joseph's theology; it plays an integral role in preaching the gospel, as well as in performing the ordinances of the temple. Joseph first used the phrase "endowed with power from on high" to refer not to the temple but to that meeting where the high priesthood was first received.

## chapter 8

Bushman feels that Joseph's expectations of finding many converts when he arrived in Missouri were not a revelation but just a hope. He paints the command to maintain the church in both Kirtland and Ohio as a way for God to temper the zeal of the church in moving to Missouri.

Bushman is also willing to demonstrate how Joseph's New Jerusalem project was similar to the broader millenarianism and communitarianism of the period. Bushman says that while Mormons watched for signs of the Second Coming, they never placed an exact date on the event like other groups did. This is true, although there was certainly plenty of speculation and Bushman says that at this time Mormons thought it would be within six years. Many of Joseph's revelations at this time were about the coming calamities that would befall the unbelieving.

Funny note: the original version of D&C 63:36 is found in the Book of Commandments section 64 v. 38-40 and says "I willeth that my saints should be assembled upon the land of Zion." "I willeth" is certainly a new one.

The revelations never spoke about America or its Constitution as anything special until the Missouri persecutions made Mormons desire protection by rule of law.

Bushman mentions that spare money often went to buying land in Missouri. This may make it seem less unfair that the Missouri United Order was expected to back the loan taken out by the Kirtland branch.

As the Book of Commandments was being prepared for publication, the conference of elders asked Joseph to "correct those errors or mistakes which he may discover by the holy Spirit". Joseph's willingness to do this suggests that he never saw the wording as infallible.

## chapter 9

Booth wrote some criticisms of Joseph in the *Ohio Star*. While Joseph denied them, Booth was right in saying that Joseph was fierce when contradicted. Bushman says it was Booth's letters that brought the sentiment against Joseph to a boiling point, causing the tar-and-feathering of Joseph and Sidney. Fawn Brodie says this was the only violence against the Mormons in Ohio, and while that might be true Bushman goes into more detail about how mobs harrassed Sidney and Joseph specifically until they were forced to go to Missouri for a while. You can read Booth's letters [here](https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Ezra_Booth_letters).

In Missouri, Joseph had Sidney and Edward Partridge make amends. Sidney had been angry with Edward for "questioning Joseph's prediction of a large branch in Jackson County in 1831." That doesn't seem to fit how Brodie thinks Sidney reacted to his first visit to Missouri.

The United Order was God's way of preparing the Saints for Heaven: "If ye are not equal in earthly things, ye cannot be equal in obtaining heavenly things." This contradicted the burgeoning capitalist feeling of 19th century America, and was difficult for the Saints. Bushman states that "the system never worked properly," and it was never implemented after expulsion from Missouri in 1833. From then on, "it had a second life as an ideal invoked whenever a cooperative effort was required."

Joseph was very earnest in his letters, even to his wife and close associates. His letters often evoked a sense of yearning for "communion without words". He felt he could not adequately communicate in the "little narrow prison" of a "crooked broken scattered and imperfect language."

The period of 1832 and early 1833 were when Joseph received his next level of revelations, moving "beyond Zion, the gathering, and the millennium, the governing ideas of the early years, to priesthood, endowment, and exaltation, the distinguishing doctrines of later years."

## chapter 10

Joseph's visions on exaltation were "undisciplined and oracular, like the Bible itself," and responded to "post-Calvinist" questions about how a just God could rightly bless or condemn certain people. "The Vision" (D&C 76) was received in view of others, as was normal, but by both Sidney and Joseph, which was not. Emanuel Swedenborg had a similar idea about dividing heaven into "celestial", "spiritual", and "natural", and his ideas may have reached Joseph by the time of the Vision, but Bushman thinks it's more likely that Corinthians 15:40-42 inspired both men.

Bushman freely admits that the cosmology of the Book of Mormon was purely heaven and hell, but points out that the same month the Book of Mormon was published Joseph had a revelation stating that "endless punishment" meant God's punishment, rather than punishment without end. And D&C 76 isn't *really* universalist; there's still a hell where a few select people will end up.

D&C 76 has some language ("exalted", "joint heirs with the Son of God", etc.) that possibly came from a Salem pastor named Brown Emerson. But where Protestant ideas about heaven focused on serenity and peace, Joseph's revelation focused on becoming like God in the same way Christ is like God. "'Fulness' was the critical word in Joseph's exaltation revelations."

> Joseph loved "The Vision." "Nothing could be more pleasing to the Saint[s], upon the order of the kingdom of the Lord," he wrote later, remembering only the favorable reception, than the light which burst upon the world, through the foregoing vision. ... The sublimity of the ideas; the purity of the language; the scope for action; the continued duration for completion, in order that the heirs of salvation, may confess the Lord and bow the knee; The rewards for faithfulness. & the punishment of sins, are so much beyond the narrow mindedness of men, that, every honest man is constrained to exclaim; It came from God."

Joseph first started talking about the endowment of power back in 1831 when the Melchizedek Priesthood was conferred, and later that year another revelation told him that the endowment of power meant coming into the presence of God. In 1832, the revelation on the priesthood connected the endowment of power with the temple. It seems to Bushman like the goal was to see God's face just as Moses tried to get his people to do (see D&C 84:23-24).

Joseph started foot washing in the winter of 1833, and by 1836 he was performing washings, anointings, and sealings.

## chapter 11

Plans for the Kirtland temple were laid by spring 1833, and by that time the temple's value seemed to be as an all-purpose church building, with general meeting areas, a place for the School of the Prophets, and offices for the presidency of the church. It was also kept in mind that the temple was to be a holy place where the church would see God's face. The construction of the temple was an economic disaster: it caused the church to go into massive debt and only briefly improved the economy around Kirtland before dropping it dramatically after construction finished.

In June 1833, membership in Missouri approached eight hundred, and there were fewer members in Kirtland. "Joseph usually wrote [letters] to Phelps, the newspaper editor, rather than Bishop Partridge, the man in charge of dividing properties in Zion." Joseph blamed the leadership in Missouri for the failings of the United Order, and the leaders in Zion blamed Joseph for "seeking after monarchal power and authority."

An interesting note about the term "ward":

> Zion was to be the capital, but Kirtland was to be a city too, implying an expandable network of urban places, with Zion first among many. People could gather to any of these cities, not to Zion alone. Joseph thought of the Church as an assemblage of cities, rather than a scattering of parishes and congregations. New converts met in branches, but only temporarily until they could gather to a city. When Joseph formed parishes in Nauvoo, he called them "wards," a term used for urban political divisons.

Here Bushman makes an incredibly insightful point about how this view of the Church as a gathering to cities ended up hurting the Mormon project:

> The conception of a church of cities rather than a church of congregations had wide-reaching---and disastrous---implications for the Mormons. Even in America, the scheme was doomed. No American community was ready for that degree of religious rejuvenation. What would happen to citizens who refused to put "Holiness to the Lord" on their storefronts? Zion could not be forced on a settled area without meeting resistance. Church leaders could not take over city planning, require holiness, equalize property, and control politics without making enemies. Wherever the Saints settled, conflict followed. In the thrall of his visions, Joseph overlooked the practical obstacles.

In August 1833, Oliver Cowdery informed the Kirtland leaders that the Mormons had been expelled from Jackson county, which completely disrupted Joseph's plans for the city of Zion.

The leaders of the Missourians who forced the Mormons out felt they had legitimate cause to do so, not as "a mob but the people in action." They were enacting democracy in self-defense. But for the Mormon minority, this was political and religious repression.

This expulsion was a huge shock to Joseph, who thought God had assured him that the plans for Zion would go through. This also became the impetus for Joseph to receive his first revelations having anything to do with politics or the nation of the United States.

## chapter 12

Joseph created the 1832 account of his life sort of in response to the publishing of the Hurlbut affidavits. In it he talked about his youth as "anguished and searching"; "the failure of religious people to follow a 'holy walk' was 'a grief to my Soul.'" This is not how Lucy described him, much less the Hurlbut affidavits.

"[Joseph's] journal entries, usually five or six lines jotted down casually when he had a spare moment, reveal a striving young man uncertain of his standing with God, yearning to be worthy, grateful when he finds peace," (p. 234). A lot of his journal entries were prayers to God, for forgiveness, for guidance, for safety, or for specific needs.

Bushman notes that the Book of Mormon does not give very helpful guidance on the question of violence: "The *Book of Mormon* contained examples of extreme pacifism and equally vigorous militarism," (p. 235).
