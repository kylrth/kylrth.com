*I'm reading this book at the same time as* [No man knows my history: the life of Joseph Smith]({{< relref "no-man-knows.md" >}}) *by Fawn Brodie, and I'm comparing what the two cover. Interesting things that appear in both books might be covered here or there.*

## preface

> A believing historian like myself cannot hope to rise above these battles or pretend nothing personal is at stake. For a character as controversial as Smith, pure objectivity is impossible. What I can do is look frankly at all sides of Joseph Smith, facing up to his mistakes and flaws. (Preface)

Bushman's goal here is to get into the mind of Joseph Smith, and for that he needs "to think as Smith thought and to reconstruct the beliefs of his followers as they understood them." We have to take at face value the fact that Joseph felt his life was guided by these specifically revealed words from God.

## chapter 1

This chapter explains the lives of Joseph's grandparents and parents, as well as the events leading up to the family settling in Palmyra. Sadly, the Smiths and the Macks had attained land ownership and reasonable wealth but Joseph Sr. and Lucy lost theirs due to unfortunate financial dealings. This was what caused the family to have to move so frequently.

It was also interesting to hear about the religious heritage that Joseph Jr. received. His paternal grandfather was a Universalist, his other grandfather had an evangelical conversion at the end of his life, and his father wanted religion but distrusted the institutions of religion that he encountered. Meanwhile his mother was frustrated by her husband's lack of interest in institutional religion and desperately wanted to find a church that met her desires.
