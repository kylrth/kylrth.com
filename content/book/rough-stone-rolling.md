*I'm reading this book at the same time as* [No man knows my history: the life of Joseph Smith]({{< relref "no-man-knows.md" >}}) *by Fawn Brodie, and I'm comparing what the two cover. Interesting things that appear in both books might be covered here or there.*

## preface

> A believing historian like myself cannot hope to rise above these battles or pretend nothing personal is at stake. For a character as controversial as Smith, pure objectivity is impossible. What I can do is look frankly at all sides of Joseph Smith, facing up to his mistakes and flaws. (Preface)

Bushman's goal here is to get into the mind of Joseph Smith, and for that he needs "to think as Smith thought and to reconstruct the beliefs of his followers as they understood them." We have to take at face value the fact that Joseph felt his life was guided by these specifically revealed words from God.

## chapter 1

This chapter explains the lives of Joseph's grandparents and parents, as well as the events leading up to the family settling in Palmyra. Sadly, the Smiths and the Macks had attained land ownership and reasonable wealth but Joseph Sr. and Lucy lost theirs due to unfortunate financial dealings. This was what caused the family to have to move so frequently.

It was also interesting to hear about the religious heritage that Joseph Jr. received. His paternal grandfather was a Universalist, his other grandfather had an evangelical conversion at the end of his life, and his father wanted religion but distrusted the institutions of religion that he encountered. Meanwhile his mother was frustrated by her husband's lack of interest in institutional religion and desperately wanted to find a church that met her desires.

## chapter 2

Bushman notes that after his visit with the angel Moroni Joseph brought the religious unification the Smith family had been seeking. According to Brodie, Joseph's mother and several siblings stopped attending the Methodist church a year later in September 1828, so this fits together.

While Brodie focuses her description on the money-digging practices of Joseph and his family, Bushman demonstrates that there are likely just as many stories of money-digging among their neighbors. It was interesting to learn that when a group searched the Smith home for the plates, they brought the neighbor Sally Chase who had a "green glass, through which she could see many very wonderful things." William Chase, her older brother, was "the most vigorous of the Manchester treasure-seekers" and also a Methodist class leader. It's clear that treasure seeking was an important part of the culture surrounding Joseph, even for religious people.

The Smiths apparently believed in rod and stone divining, the astrology found in the almanacs published in their day, and magical parchments that were later passed down through the Hyrum Smith family.

Several accounts agree that Joseph found the plates using his seer stone, so it makes sense that the first time Joseph tried to retrieve the plates, he had in mind the idea to make money with them. Bushman argues that Moroni's instructions "connected the greed of the money-digger with the powers of Satan", and so it may have been that the four years spent trying to obtain the plates were to help Joseph "purge himself of his treasure-seeking greed." (According to [this article](https://www.jstor.org/stable/45225965?seq=16#metadata_info_tab_contents)) by Dan Vogel, Joseph had engaged in digging on the Hill Cumorah with others during the years leading up to his receiving the plates.)

Joseph told Alva Hale that "the 'gift in seeing with a stone' was 'a gift from God' but that '*peeping* was all damned nonsense'." Bushman interprets this to argue that Joseph was shifting away from "glass-looking" and toward the divine role of a seer. Bushman doesn't trust the account of Peter Ingersoll when he says that "Joseph acknowledged [to Isaac Hale] that 'he could not see in a stone now, nor never could.'" Bushman points out that Joseph never said anything like this at any other time, and I would add that it would be easy for Ingersoll to sum up Joseph's repudiation of glass-looking as a repudiation of his stone.
