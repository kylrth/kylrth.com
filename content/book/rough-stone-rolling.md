## preface

> A believing historian like myself cannot hope to rise above these battles or pretend nothing personal is at stake. For a character as controversial as Smith, pure objectivity is impossible. What I can do is look frankly at all sides of Joseph Smith, facing up to his mistakes and flaws. (Preface)

Bushman's goal here is to get into the mind of Joseph Smith, and for that he needs "to think as Smith thought and to reconstruct the beliefs of his followers as they understood them." We have to take at face value the fact that Joseph felt his life was guided by these specifically revealed words from God.
