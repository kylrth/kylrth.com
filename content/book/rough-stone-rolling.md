*I'm reading this book at the same time as* [No man knows my history: the life of Joseph Smith]({{< relref "no-man-knows.md" >}}) *by Fawn Brodie, and I'm comparing what the two cover. Interesting things that appear in both books might be covered here or there.*

## preface

> A believing historian like myself cannot hope to rise above these battles or pretend nothing personal is at stake. For a character as controversial as Smith, pure objectivity is impossible. What I can do is look frankly at all sides of Joseph Smith, facing up to his mistakes and flaws. (Preface)

Bushman's goal here is to get into the mind of Joseph Smith, and for that he needs "to think as Smith thought and to reconstruct the beliefs of his followers as they understood them." We have to take at face value the fact that Joseph felt his life was guided by these specifically revealed words from God.

## chapter 1

This chapter explains the lives of Joseph's grandparents and parents, as well as the events leading up to the family settling in Palmyra. Sadly, the Smiths and the Macks had attained land ownership and reasonable wealth but Joseph Sr. and Lucy lost theirs due to unfortunate financial dealings. This was what caused the family to have to move so frequently.

It was also interesting to hear about the religious heritage that Joseph Jr. received. His paternal grandfather was a Universalist, his other grandfather had an evangelical conversion at the end of his life, and his father wanted religion but distrusted the institutions of religion that he encountered. Meanwhile his mother was frustrated by her husband's lack of interest in institutional religion and desperately wanted to find a church that met her desires.

## chapter 2

Bushman notes that after his visit with the angel Moroni Joseph brought the religious unification the Smith family had been seeking. According to Brodie, Joseph's mother and several siblings stopped attending the Methodist church a year later in September 1828, so this fits together.

While Brodie focuses her description on the money-digging practices of Joseph and his family, Bushman demonstrates that there are likely just as many stories of money-digging among their neighbors. It was interesting to learn that when a group searched the Smith home for the plates, they brought the neighbor Sally Chase who had a "green glass, through which she could see many very wonderful things." William Chase, her older brother, was "the most vigorous of the Manchester treasure-seekers" and also a Methodist class leader. It's clear that treasure seeking was an important part of the culture surrounding Joseph, even for religious people.

The Smiths apparently believed in rod and stone divining, the astrology found in the almanacs published in their day, and magical parchments that were later passed down through the Hyrum Smith family.

Several accounts agree that Joseph found the plates using his seer stone, so it makes sense that the first time Joseph tried to retrieve the plates, he had in mind the idea to make money with them. Bushman argues that Moroni's instructions "connected the greed of the money-digger with the powers of Satan", and so it may have been that the four years spent trying to obtain the plates were to help Joseph "purge himself of his treasure-seeking greed." (According to [this article](https://www.jstor.org/stable/45225965?seq=16#metadata_info_tab_contents)) by Dan Vogel, Joseph had engaged in digging on the Hill Cumorah with others during the years leading up to his receiving the plates.)

Joseph told Alva Hale that "the 'gift in seeing with a stone' was 'a gift from God' but that '*peeping* was all damned nonsense'." Bushman interprets this to argue that Joseph was shifting away from "glass-looking" and toward the divine role of a seer. Bushman doesn't trust the account of Peter Ingersoll when he says that "Joseph acknowledged [to Isaac Hale] that 'he could not see in a stone now, nor never could.'" Bushman points out that Joseph never said anything like this at any other time, and I would add that it would be easy for Ingersoll to sum up Joseph's repudiation of glass-looking as a repudiation of his stone.

## chapter 3

Bushman points out that one thing all close accounts have in common is physical references to the plates Joseph was translating. Brodie points to a story of Joseph filling his frock with sand and saying it was the plates. Vogel thinks there might have been tin plates. Contemporaries thought he might have wrapped a tile brick in a cloth.

Bushman feels that "hunting for deception" misses the point. The point is that people believed Joseph, by the thousands.

Martin Harris was initially skeptical, and asked the story of each Smith family member individually to check for contradictions. He hefted the box containing the plates, and went home. When he prayed that night, the still small voice confirmed to him that it was true.

Several primary sources indicate that Harris went to New York City with the intention of getting the characters translated. It sounds like they thought if they could get translations for a majority of the characters they could continue by himself. But what Harris did was ask if the translation was correct. In Anthon's 1834 account, he denies giving Harris a written opinion, but in 1841 he gave a written opinion that the characters were false, in an attempt to expose the fraud.

Bushman states that the characters are identifiably Egyptian, but he doesn't seem to have a source for this. We don't even have the actual Anthon transcript, because the "Charactors" document was produced later than Harris's trip and doesn't match Anthon's description. Harris says Anthon certified that "the characters were Egyptian, Chaldaic, Assyriac, and Arabic", which makes very little sense.

Joseph didn't refer to the Aaronic Priesthood restoration (set in 1829) until 1832, and then only barely. The story got into its final state in 1838. Bushman explains this (along with Joseph's phased introduction of the First Vision) as evidence that Joseph was careful about revealing divine manifestations to others. But he was often so quickly willing to share revelations (received through the stone or otherwise) that I doubt this explanation. It does seem that by 1834 this event was common knowledge, because Cowdery reveled in his experience in a church newspaper.

To Brodie's retelling of times when Joseph couldn't translate, Bushman adds that in a particular case it was because of being angry with Emma that Joseph had to pray and repent before returning to the work.

Bushman tells the story of receiving the ordination to elder as a separate occurrence from the appearance of Peter, James, and John to bestow keys of Apostleship, and without any angels appearing.

I've heard mention of Joseph trying to sell the copyright to the Book of Mormon in Canada, but never had read enough information. Here's Bushman's account:

> The alarmed inhabitants of "the surrounding country" resolved never to purchase the Book of Mormon and tried to persuade Grandin [the publisher] to stop publication. They argued that since the Smiths had lost their farm they could not pay him unless the book sold, and they were not buying. Having entered the contract reluctantly in the first place, Grandin stopped work until he could be assured of payment. In an attempt to start the presses again, Harris consented to sell part of his farm to raise some cash, although only after getting a signed agreement from Joseph Sr. giving Harris the right to sell books on his own account. Impatient with Harris's reluctance, Hyrum urged Joseph to leave him out entirely and raise the money by other means. Hyrum had heard that the copyright could be sold in Canada and asked Joseph to inquire of the Lord. David Whitmer later reported that Joseph told Cowdery and Hiram Page to go to Toronto and promised them success, but the two returned empty-handed. They had to depend on Harris after all.

## chapter 4

Bushman points out that many consider the Book of Mormon overly simple and boring, while others see great depth and extract a lot of meaning, though that generally falls along church membership lines.

In Bushman's section on criticisms of the Book of Mormon, he mentions that apologists defend the lack of horse artifacts in America by pointing out that there's no archaeological evidence of the Huns using horses either. I think this bothers me in particular because the horse issue is to me a strong evidence of 19th century authorship. So I did some reading on Wikipedia. A few things:

- The Huns were nomadic, which meant they did not congregate in large numbers like agrarian societies do.
- The Huns were never as large in population as the Lehites were said to be in the Book of Mormon.

Bushman says it's unlikely that the Smith family spent any time musing about the origin of the Indians, but then talks at length about the various theories passed around for the origin. It is interesting to hear evidence that the Lost Tribes theory was not the most popular of the origin theories.

*View of the Hebrews* is sort of a summary of the Israelite origin theory. Bushman discredits *View of the Hebrews* as a source document for the Book of Mormon because it's purpose is different. This sidesteps the problem, rather than addressing the fact that *View of the Hebrews* includes a story of Israelites coming to America by boat and splitting into two groups (one civilized and the other savage), with the savage civilization eventually destroying the civilized.

One of Bushman's stronger points is that the Book of Mormon does not contain the obvious references to Indian culture that you might expect, like corn, tepees, braves, or feathers. But he does admit that the Book of Mormon refers to the Lamanites as blood-thirsty and bare-chested, pointing out that the Book of Mormon view of the Lamanites is similar to the Jacksonian view of Indians common to most Americans in 1830.

Bushman allays criticisms of racism in the Book of Mormon by mentioning that the Indians are God's chosen people descended from Israelites, more chosen than the European Gentiles settling America who God requires to help the Indians.

I really enjoyed Bushman's discussion of how the Book of Mormon interprets the Bible. "The Jews have their revelations in Palestine, the Nephites have theirs in the Western Hemisphere. Beyond these two, all the tribes of Israel produce bibles, each containing its own revelation: [cites 2 Nephi 29:12] ... Every nation will receive it's measure of revelation: [cites Alma 29:8]. The tiny land of Palestine does not begin to encompass the revelation flooding the earth. Biblical revelation is generalized to the whole world. All peoples have their epic stories and their sacred books. ... The world is a hive of bible-making."

## chapter 5

The first coverts to the church were often visionaries or seekers, because the offer of new revelation enticed them.

The first persecution that Mormons experienced was after the baptism of several members of the Knight family. They were followed back from the baptism by a mob, and then Joseph was charged with being a disorderly person, likely trying to draw from the past charges over money digging.

At the beginning of the church, Joseph received a revelation to get his support from the church, but also to plant his fields.

While Joseph had stopped using a seer stone after completing the Book of Mormon, Hiram Page started receiving revelations through a stone and David Whitmer thought that was important. Joseph very early on had to correct for this (as well as some changes Cowdery wanted to make to the Articles of the church) and establish the kind of authority the prophet's revelations were going to have. This quick action united the group under Joseph's authority and marked the new movement as a church rather than a charismatic sect.

After establishing the church, the next task was to preach to the Indians and set up a site for a temple for New Jerusalem.

I had no idea that Rigdon was baptized in Ohio while Cowdery was on his way to Missouri, and then Joseph's whole church moved to Ohio after persecution increased in New York.

## chapter 6

Joseph's revelations differed from those of other prophets in the period because they spoke directly as God without intermediary, they were considered equivalent to scripture, and Joseph's followers regarded them much higher than Joseph's own voice. Joseph dictated the revelations (commandments) in much the same way as the Book of Mormon: slowly, out loud, and without hesitation or review.

Joseph's project of the Bible translation demonstrates his extreme confidence as a prophet at that point.

I had no idea Joseph had gotten started on the Book of Moses so soon after the creation of the church.

The major themes of the Book of Moses were these:

- The full Gospel has been around since the beginning of time, rather than being gradually revealed until Jesus came and finished it.
- Prophethood is an ordeal, a battle between forces of good and evil.
- Moses 1:39
- The theme of cosmic inquiry would continue to play a role in Joseph's prophethood.
- apocalypse (in the section on Enoch)
- sorrow for the sins of the world
- linking latter-day history with biblical history (through Zion)

Joseph's expansion on the story of Enoch was happening just as "a vast apocryphal literature on Enoch was first being rediscovered," but it's unlikely Joseph knew about the Ethiopic text in time. The two are only similar in that they make references to the Son of Man and other New Testament titles for Christ.

Joseph identified with Enoch the most. He used the name as a pseudonym later in life.
