Just like everything else, capitalism has screwed over our diets by giving companies the incentive to put shareholders above customers. Food companies employ lobbyists to keep subsidies on sugar/corn syrup/meat, and keep a stranglehold on public organizations. They buy billions of dollars of ads to communicate the message that it's laziness that has caused the obesity epidemic and to push their products that appeal to the unconscious desires of our brains to produce artificial hunger.

A CDC study showed that overweight people had better life expectancy than normal weight people, leading to the idea of an "obesity paradox". But larger studies that accounted for smokers (who are thinner because of nicotine) and things like that showed that the best BMI was 20-22, which is the lower half of the "normal" BMI range.

Fat stigmatization has gotten worse, not better, and just like any shame-based motivation it doesn't work.

The percentage of people who consider themselves overweight has not changed over the past few decades, even though the proportion of overweight people has ballooned over that period.

Supplements are very poorly regulated because the fines are nothing compared to the profits.

Food corporations are incentivized to create cheap, non-perishable, sugary/fatty foods. The way to combat this is similar to how the tobacco industry was battled:

1. taxes on products
1. labels on packaging
1. no advertising to children

The reality is that people don't make rational choices with food purchasing, so the free market by itself will not create the solution. When a healthy option is added to the menu, you are more likely to choose the least healthy option. People donate/buy less when an ad uses an anecdote and statistics than when just an anecdote is used.
