Richard Bushman categorizes those who leave the church into two broad categories: those who feel "switched off", and those who feel "squeezed out". Mason summarizes the switched-off group as those who encounter troubling information about church history or doctrine, and then as they discover more and more information that they didn't know they become jaded by it until they can no longer see the good the church does for them or for others. The squeezed-out group "fully embrace[s] the basic principles and ordinances of the gospel. But sometimes they feel alienated by things like the dominant political conservatism among the members ... or how the church ministers to our LGBT ... brothers and sisters," (p. 3).

The church has done a lot of good over the past few years to start discussing difficult issues in church history and policy. They've come out with the Gospel Topics essays and created the Joseph Smith Papers project.

Most people with serious doubts already know the answers that faithful people will provide. "Most people don't really want to be solved. They want to be heard, valued, and as much as possible understood," (p. 7). Mason wants this book to be a conversation with both serious doubters and those with solid faith, so that there is understanding and love. To Mason, including this in the culture of the church may be the most important factor in helping people choose to stay in or join the church.

## faith and trust in a secular age

There are some people who believe all their lives, and things that cause some to doubt only seem to strengthen the faith of these people. (Mason says this could be the gift of faith, but I would ask if it is truly a gift not to question.) Faith is a lot like love: it's a matter of hope and trust. When two people first tell each other they love each other, it is mostly based on hope and confidence in one another. When the expectations are violated by deceit or misunderstanding, it is heartbreaking because it violates that confidence.

Mason recognizes a few common patterns that arise for people in a faith crisis:

- It's often the active, committed church members that go online looking for answers to someone else's doubts who end up surprised and troubled by what they find.
- Leaders often respond to expressed doubts either by suspecting unworthiness or by telling the doubter that their sincere doubts and questions are sinful.
  - The doubter then feels judged or ignored, and finds online communities where they feel understood, because it seems like people care about truth regardless of the consequences.
- "Many of these people end up staying in the church, usually for family reasons, but they withdraw into themselves," (p. 15). Hearing talks or testimonies at church that don't match with what they've read online then further convinces them of the church's duplicity.
- This sudden change in their belief in the church causes the doubter to doubt past spiritual experiences, often leading them to doubt the existence of God and the moral standards taught by the church.
- Family and friends tell the person to study their scriptures, pray, and serve in the church, but the person has already been doing those things.

Here are some of the common concerns of those close to someone in faith crisis:

- **parents**: that person will be missing from family events, but more importantly missing from the celestial kingdom
- **spouse**: the basis for the marriage (temple covenants) is no longer believed in or held sacred by the person. So much of their life together has been built around church events, gospel practice, and social relationships built in the church. What will happen to the marriage? to their relationships with others? What will happen when one parent doesn't want their kids in the  church but the other does? Will we become the outcasts or projects of the ward?

Mason emphasizes that it is usually not a desire to sin that leads people to come up with issues with church history so they can have an excuse not to believe. In addition, reading scriptures and praying are rarely enough to solve life's hardest problems, including a faith crisis. The scriptures themselves tell us to mourn with people who mourn, and comfort and bless people who are struggling (Mosiah 18:8-9), so giving a "formulaic answer" leaves people feeling unloved.

Secularism isn't an inherently bad thing like some religious people believe. Secularism provides religious freedom and makes it possible for people of different religions to successfully share the same nation and work together. It also has brought us the preeminence of science and reason in our society. Secularism hasn't brought the end of religion like some thought it would.

Many of the arguments we find online look like new information, because they're from recent blog posts and they present information that's new to us. That makes it hard to recognize that there are people out there who are aware of the factual information presented but still faithfully believe in the church's teachings. That's why it's important to remember to look for answers from inside the church as well.

## testimony

> One of the primary ways that Christianity scandalizes the twenty-first-century mind is in its insistence that all people, whatever the location or condition of their birth, must believe in and follow the singular Way, Truth, and Life that is Jesus Christ. (p. 26)

In Mormon theology, we are all eternal beings who chose to become God's children. We had personalities before this life, and those personalities are then filtered through the great variety of human experience to become our individual characters. Mason broadens the definition of *testimony* to include all experience with God and any commitment to live a religious life.

In the premodern world, the concept of changing religions or leaving a religion was basically non-existent. Communities tended to believe similar things to those next to them, and radical changes were the exception. Religion was not a separate category of human activity from anything else. "In the space of a few short centuries we went 'from a society in which it was virtually impossible not to believe in God, to one in which faith, even for the staunchest believer, is [only] one human possibility among others,'" (p. 28). It is natural for a religion to be a relationship: you hold onto it through testimony, and it holds onto you through family, obligation, and community.

Nephi's faith took belief as a given and focused on faithfulness, while both Almas' faith focused on becoming truly converted to the Savior and his gospel. The Book of Mormon illustrates these two different types of testimony, and Mason argues that there are as many kinds of testimony as there are people who believe. In this age, it is very common for a testimony to have to interact with doubt on some level.

Our level of faith or doubt is often inherited by upbringing. Apparently, there are even genetic factors associated with belief. Unfortunately, in our church we sometimes treat doubt as a character flaw. We should be as inclusive as possible to people's doubts (or lack thereof).

Why does God allow doubt to be so pervasive for many of us? Why did God allow Mother Teresa to spend most of her life anxiously searching for the divine, but without any response? The philosopher Michael Rae offers a few ideas:

- to preserve human freedom and the integrity of moral choice. An important trope in *The Good Place* is that once you know how the system works you're basically doomed to the Bad Place because you won't do anything good out of unselfishness. A hidden God makes it possible for us to do good without knowing for sure what the rewards will be.
- the cultivation of attributes like patience, hunger for the divine, and gratitude for the communication we do receive
- to teach us that God cannot be manipulated by us
- to teach us that God values *communion* at least as much as he values direct communication

Pondering or questioning the mechanics of belief doesn't have to be seen as an attack on belief, but can be the driving force behind our religious action.

> I go to church with people who see God in the little things---when their car breaks down and someone on the freeway stops to help them or in the check that inexplicably arrives in the mail when times are tight. Other active Mormons don't live that way and instead find God in scripture, the temple, the sacrament, church social events, or personal meditation. Others still, whom we might call religious but not spiritual, are drawn to and anchored by the community, tradition, and structure of Mormonism but infrequently have transcendent "spiritual experiences" to bear testimony of. (p. 36-37)

"[God's] hiddenness does not constitute abandonment or even necessarily a rebuke," (p. 37). It's hard for anyone to imagine questioning Mother Teresa's integrity or telling her to try harder. "Teresa's discipleship was a life choice based on her commitment to Jesus and was not reliant on constant reaffirmations," (p. 38).

I think that I have the motivation within me to dedicate my life to doing good like Mother Teresa, without the need for a witness that there is a god watching my actions. That much I can do. Maybe the difference is that I'm not willing to do it within a religious context?

All of us are born with proclivities and gifts that make our religious experience unique. It is wrong to measure other people's faith through the lense of our own journey. Mason illustrates this by talking about a mission companion he had who would much rather "dig wells or build houses somewhere in Africa" than preach the gospel in Seattle. For Mason, serving the Lord meant teaching the gospel, but this missionary felt more inspired by something else.

> The quest to eradicate all doubt becomes counterproductive to God's call for us to live by faith in a mortal existence where uncertainty is so often the norm. ... The call to belief is not a decree to deny our doubts. It is rather to "give place for a portion" of God's light---whatever portion we have received, in whatever form---to be planted and then grow within us. (p. 43)

I think I have faith in a few things. At my core I choose to believe that doing good to others is my moral obligation. I also choose to believe that most people are doing the best they can with the knowledge and experience that they have. I can hold to these things despite what others say or do. These can be the tenets of my personal faith.
