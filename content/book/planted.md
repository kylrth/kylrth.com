Richard Bushman categorizes those who leave the church into two broad categories: those who feel "switched off", and those who feel "squeezed out". Mason summarizes the switched-off group as those who encounter troubling information about church history or doctrine, and then as they discover more and more information that they didn't know they become jaded by it until they can no longer see the good the church does for them or for others. The squeezed-out group "fully embrace[s] the basic principles and ordinances of the gospel. But sometimes they feel alienated by things like the dominant political conservatism among the members ... or how the church ministers to our LGBT ... brothers and sisters," (p. 3).

The church has done a lot of good over the past few years to start discussing difficult issues in church history and policy. They've come out with the Gospel Topics essays and created the Joseph Smith Papers project.

Most people with serious doubts already know the answers that faithful people will provide. "Most people don't really want to be solved. They want to be heard, valued, and as much as possible understood," (p. 7). Mason wants this book to be a conversation with both serious doubters and those with solid faith, so that there is understanding and love. To Mason, including this in the culture of the church may be the most important factor in helping people choose to stay in or join the church.

## faith and trust in a secular age

There are some people who believe all their lives, and things that cause some to doubt only seem to strengthen the faith of these people. (Mason says this could be the gift of faith, but I would ask if it is truly a gift not to question.) Faith is a lot like love: it's a matter of hope and trust. When two people first tell each other they love each other, it is mostly based on hope and confidence in one another. When the expectations are violated by deceit or misunderstanding, it is heartbreaking because it violates that confidence.

Mason recognizes a few common patterns that arise for people in a faith crisis:

- It's often the active, committed church members that go online looking for answers to someone else's doubts who end up surprised and troubled by what they find.
- Leaders often respond to expressed doubts either by suspecting unworthiness or by telling the doubter that their sincere doubts and questions are sinful.
  - The doubter then feels judged or ignored, and finds online communities where they feel understood, because it seems like people care about truth regardless of the consequences.
- "Many of these people end up staying in the church, usually for family reasons, but they withdraw into themselves," (p. 15). Hearing talks or testimonies at church that don't match with what they've read online then further convinces them of the church's duplicity.
- This sudden change in their belief in the church causes the doubter to doubt past spiritual experiences, often leading them to doubt the existence of God and the moral standards taught by the church.
- Family and friends tell the person to study their scriptures, pray, and serve in the church, but the person has already been doing those things.

Here are some of the common concerns of those close to someone in faith crisis:

- **parents**: that person will be missing from family events, but more importantly missing from the celestial kingdom
- **spouse**: the basis for the marriage (temple covenants) is no longer believed in or held sacred by the person. So much of their life together has been built around church events, gospel practice, and social relationships built in the church. What will happen to the marriage? to their relationships with others? What will happen when one parent doesn't want their kids in the  church but the other does? Will we become the outcasts or projects of the ward?

Mason emphasizes that it is usually not a desire to sin that leads people to come up with issues with church history so they can have an excuse not to believe. In addition, reading scriptures and praying are rarely enough to solve life's hardest problems, including a faith crisis. The scriptures themselves tell us to mourn with people who mourn, and comfort and bless people who are struggling (Mosiah 18:8-9), so giving a "formulaic answer" leaves people feeling unloved.

Secularism isn't an inherently bad thing like some religious people believe. Secularism provides religious freedom and makes it possible for people of different religions to successfully share the same nation and work together. It also has brought us the preeminence of science and reason in our society. Secularism hasn't brought the end of religion like some thought it would.

Many of the arguments we find online look like new information, because they're from recent blog posts and they present information that's new to us. That makes it hard to recognize that there are people out there who are aware of the factual information presented but still faithfully believe in the church's teachings. That's why it's important to remember to look for answers from inside the church as well.
