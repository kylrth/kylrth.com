Richard Bushman categorizes those who leave the church into two broad categories: those who feel "switched off", and those who feel "squeezed out". Mason summarizes the switched-off group as those who encounter troubling information about church history or doctrine, and then as they discover more and more information that they didn't know they become jaded by it until they can no longer see the good the church does for them or for others. The squeezed-out group "fully embrace[s] the basic principles and ordinances of the gospel. But sometimes they feel alienated by things like the dominant political conservatism among the members ... or how the church ministers to our LGBT ... brothers and sisters," (p. 3).

The church has done a lot of good over the past few years to start discussing difficult issues in church history and policy. They've come out with the Gospel Topics essays and created the Joseph Smith Papers project.

Most people with serious doubts already know the answers that faithful people will provide. "Most people don't really want to be solved. They want to be heard, valued, and as much as possible understood," (p. 7). Mason wants this book to be a conversation with both serious doubters and those with solid faith, so that there is understanding and love. To Mason, including this in the culture of the church may be the most important factor in helping people choose to stay in or join the church.

## faith and trust in a secular age

There are some people who believe all their lives, and things that cause some to doubt only seem to strengthen the faith of these people. (Mason says this could be the gift of faith, but I would ask if the tendency not to question is really a "gift".) Faith is a lot like love: it's a matter of hope and trust. When two people first tell each other they love each other, it is mostly based on hope and confidence in one another. When the expectations are violated by deceit or misunderstanding, it is heartbreaking because it violates that confidence.

Mason recognizes a few common patterns that arise for people in a faith crisis:

- It's often the active, committed church members that go online looking for answers to someone else's doubts who end up surprised and troubled by what they find.
- Leaders often respond to expressed doubts either by suspecting unworthiness or by telling the doubter that their sincere doubts and questions are sinful.
  - The doubter then feels judged or ignored, and finds online communities where they feel understood, because it seems like people care about truth regardless of the consequences.
- "Many of these people end up staying in the church, usually for family reasons, but they withdraw into themselves," (p. 15). Hearing talks or testimonies at church that don't match with what they've read online then further convinces them of the church's duplicity.
- This sudden change in their belief in the church causes the doubter to doubt past spiritual experiences, often leading them to doubt the existence of God and the moral standards taught by the church.
- Family and friends tell the person to study their scriptures, pray, and serve in the church, but the person has already been doing those things.

Here are some of the common concerns of those close to someone in faith crisis:

- **parents**: that person will be missing from family events, but more importantly missing from the celestial kingdom
- **spouse**: the basis for the marriage (temple covenants) is no longer believed in or held sacred by the person. So much of their life together has been built around church events, gospel practice, and social relationships built in the church. What will happen to the marriage? to their relationships with others? What will happen when one parent doesn't want their kids in the church but the other does? Will we become the outcasts or projects of the ward?

Mason emphasizes that it is usually not a desire to sin that leads people to come up with issues with church history so they can have an excuse not to believe. In addition, reading scriptures and praying are rarely enough to solve life's hardest problems, including a faith crisis. The scriptures themselves tell us to mourn with people who mourn, and comfort and bless people who are struggling (Mosiah 18:8-9), so giving a "formulaic answer" leaves people feeling unloved.

Secularism isn't an inherently bad thing like some religious people believe. Secularism provides religious freedom and makes it possible for people of different religions to successfully share the same nation and work together. It also has brought us the preeminence of science and reason in our society. Secularism hasn't brought the end of religion like some thought it would.

Many of the arguments we find online look like new information, because they're from recent blog posts and they present information that's new to us. That makes it hard to recognize that there are people out there who are aware of the factual information presented but still faithfully believe in the church's teachings. That's why it's important to remember to look for answers from inside the church as well.

## testimony

> One of the primary ways that Christianity scandalizes the twenty-first-century mind is in its insistence that all people, whatever the location or condition of their birth, must believe in and follow the singular Way, Truth, and Life that is Jesus Christ. (p. 26)

In Mormon theology, we are all eternal beings who chose to become God's children. We had personalities before this life, and those personalities are then filtered through the great variety of human experience to become our individual characters. Mason broadens the definition of *testimony* to include all experience with God and any commitment to live a religious life.

In the premodern world, the concept of changing religions or leaving a religion was basically non-existent. Communities tended to believe similar things to those next to them, and radical changes were the exception. Religion was not a separate category of human activity from anything else. "In the space of a few short centuries we went 'from a society in which it was virtually impossible not to believe in God, to one in which faith, even for the staunchest believer, is [only] one human possibility among others,'" (p. 28). It is natural for a religion to be a relationship: you hold onto it through testimony, and it holds onto you through family, obligation, and community.

Nephi's faith took belief as a given and focused on faithfulness, while both Almas' faith focused on becoming truly converted to the Savior and his gospel. The Book of Mormon illustrates these two different types of testimony, and Mason argues that there are as many kinds of testimony as there are people who believe. In this age, it is very common for a testimony to have to interact with doubt on some level.

Our level of faith or doubt is often inherited by upbringing. Apparently, there are even genetic factors associated with belief. Unfortunately, in our church we sometimes treat doubt as a character flaw. We should be as inclusive as possible to people's doubts (or lack thereof).

Why does God allow doubt to be so pervasive for many of us? Why did God allow Mother Teresa to spend most of her life anxiously searching for the divine, but without any response? The philosopher Michael Rae offers a few ideas:

- to preserve human freedom and the integrity of moral choice. An important trope in *The Good Place* is that once you know how the system works you're basically doomed to the Bad Place because you won't do anything good out of unselfishness. A hidden God makes it possible for us to do good without knowing for sure what the rewards will be.
- the cultivation of attributes like patience, hunger for the divine, and gratitude for the communication we do receive
- to teach us that God cannot be manipulated by us
- to teach us that God values *communion* at least as much as he values direct communication

Pondering or questioning the mechanics of belief doesn't have to be seen as an attack on belief, but can be the driving force behind our religious action.

> I go to church with people who see God in the little things---when their car breaks down and someone on the freeway stops to help them or in the check that inexplicably arrives in the mail when times are tight. Other active Mormons don't live that way and instead find God in scripture, the temple, the sacrament, church social events, or personal meditation. Others still, whom we might call religious but not spiritual, are drawn to and anchored by the community, tradition, and structure of Mormonism but infrequently have transcendent "spiritual experiences" to bear testimony of. (p. 36-37)

"[God's] hiddenness does not constitute abandonment or even necessarily a rebuke," (p. 37). It's hard for anyone to imagine questioning Mother Teresa's integrity or telling her to try harder. "Teresa's discipleship was a life choice based on her commitment to Jesus and was not reliant on constant reaffirmations," (p. 38).

I think that I have the motivation within me to dedicate my life to doing good like Mother Teresa, without the need for a witness that there is a god watching my actions. That much I can do. Maybe the difference is that I'm not willing to do it within a religious context?

All of us are born with proclivities and gifts that make our religious experience unique. It is wrong to measure other people's faith through the lense of our own journey. Mason illustrates this by talking about a mission companion he had who would much rather "dig wells or build houses somewhere in Africa" than preach the gospel in Seattle. For Mason, serving the Lord meant teaching the gospel, but this missionary felt more inspired by something else.

> The quest to eradicate all doubt becomes counterproductive to God's call for us to live by faith in a mortal existence where uncertainty is so often the norm. ... The call to belief is not a decree to deny our doubts. It is rather to "give place for a portion" of God's light---whatever portion we have received, in whatever form---to be planted and then grow within us. (p. 43)

## foolishness and scandal

> Mormonism is sui generis---that is to say, it offers its own unique set of questions and answers for the world that overlaps with but is not identical to any other set of questions and answers, whether those posed by modern science or  creedal Christianity. What this also means, however, is that while Mormonism is internally coherent, intellectually rewarding, spiritually satisfying, and theologically profound, when viewed solely through any other lens it will appear flawed, foolish, and even scandalous. (p. 46-47)

Some ask how the church can be specially led by God if there is scandal (weird stuff) in the church's history. Mason points to Romans 9:33: "Behold, I lay in Zion a stumblingstone and rock of offense: and whosoever believeth on him shall not be ashamed." The Greek word used here is *skandalon*, root of the word *scandal* in English. Certainly the Old Testament does not leave out the scandal from Hebrew history. Mason tries to explain that God has always invited his covenant people to "quit their scandals" (p. 53), and we need to give God's people the benefit of the doubt. "Scripture reminds me not to be surprised by Zion's failings and to believe that God can redeem his people in spite of their many missteps," (p. 53).

Early Christianity was considered similarly crazy by the Greeks, and Paul recognized that the gospel was absurd according to Greek philosophical reasoning. The teachings and works of Jesus were radical, uncomfortable, and scandalizing. "In [embracing the *skandalon* of the Son of God] we realize that the *skandalon* was placed only to trip up our clumsy attachments to this world and is really meant to serve as a stepping stone to a higher life in the kingdom of God," (p. 55). "Mormonism is an affront to a dominant modern mode of thought, in the same way that the cross of Christ was foolishness in first-century Greece," (p. 48). Mason says this referring to the miraculousness of the Restoration: the seer stones, the divine manifestations, etc.

Many people who leave the church feel forced to leave by the facts they discover: how could Joseph be a prophet if what he thought was the book of Abraham was actually a common Egyptian funerary text? How could he be a prophet if he took a 14-year-old girl as a plural wife? To Mason, these facts do not obviously lead to the conclusion that the church is false. Mason points out that interpretation is the bridge from fact to conclusion, and there's always another angle from which to view the difficult topics. (For example, "it is possible to think of a prophet who genuinely hears God's voice and yet is still mistaken on some things," (p. 50).) Our judgments are dependent on our biases, some of which we're aware of and some not. It's impossible to be truly objective in our judgments, especially on something like religion that affects us so emotionally. It's important for those who leave and for those who stay to remember that the other is not necessarily ignorant of the facts, but may apply a different interpretation to those facts.

What makes Mormonism more difficult is that the stories have not had enough time to feel familiar to Western culture. Noah's ark, biblical genocide, and the discrepancy of accounts in the Gospels are not scandalous to most people because the West has been familiar with them for thousands of years. Eventually, Mormonism will look like that too.

Mason argues that "to base one's life on unfalsifiable claims is not a sign of intellectual weakness or antirationality, but rather a perfectly normal human response to the uncertainty that is the lot of mortality," (p. 57). I think that this is true. I also think that it *is* a sign of intellectual weakness and antirationality to choose to not apply rational thought to those things we base our lives on. Mason refers to the claims of the church as unfalsifiable, but are they really? Claims about cosmology might be unfalsifiable, but claims about the events of the Restoration certainly are.

In addition, it is not reasonable to use unfalsifiability as a standard of acceptability for beliefs. Religions around the world make unfalsifiable claims about the nature of existence, but we cannot believe all of them. What allows us to believe the claims of a particular religion is most often our cultural or personal familiarity with the claim. This is the *illusory truth effect*, and it has been [documented](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0022537177800121) repeatedly.

I believe that the right solution is to "base one's life" on a select few unfalsifiable claims that define moral value judgments. These are things like "all humans have equal worth and potential" and "doing good to others is my moral obligation". These are valuable unfalsifiable claims because they produce better individuals and communities without all the problematic power structures and unreasonable dogma that come with religion. I believe this is the right solution because it reduces the number of unfalsifiable things I am likely to believe. I can hold to these things despite what others say or do. These can be the tenets of my personal faith.

## unicorns and rhinoceroses

Mason introduces the difficulty of seeing into the past without ever being able to get inside the mind of someone from the past. We "anachronistically [introduce] present-day perspectives and concerns into our understanding of the past" (p. 62) if we assume too much of our own perspective when looking at history. "We inescapably make meaning out of our observations, which are themselves colored by our past experience and the filters we have developed, consciously or not," (p. 63).

Mason makes an example of Joseph's money-digging. Initially, faithful historians rejected evidence of the Smith family's money-digging and use of magic, because it was incongruous with their concept of what a prophet should look like. But even as the evidence became undeniable, other evidence was demonstrating that those practices were extremely common among the people of 18th and 19th century America, especially in Vermont and upstate New York. Folk magic was a part of Joseph's life for sure, but it played less and less of a role in his life during the years before translating the Book of Mormon. Early revelations make no mention of treasure-seeking or magic. (Mason doesn't mention that the Book of Mormon contains some references to "slippery treasures", a common glass-looking trope.) These days it's an accepted fact among all historians that Joseph and his family were involved in magic and treasure seeking, but it's no longer as big of an issue for people because we understand the cultural context better now. "The money-digging story helps us recognize that even the most apparently damning facts can be understood in a new light as historical scholarship evolves," (p. 69).

Here's a great quote that reflects Mason's argument:

> There is nothing more unstable than basing one's life and outlook purely on the latest scholarship, let alone one's casual perusal of it. (p. 72)

I don't like this because it leads one to believe that they cannot interpret the past well enough to make any condemning judgments. He advocates "reasoned faith" and the discussion of difficult issues, but he seems to be setting up the reader to believe that it's impossible to use historical facts to discredit the church, which I think is misleading.
