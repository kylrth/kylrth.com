*I'm reading this book at the same time as* [Joseph Smith: rough stone rolling]({{< relref "no-man-knows.md" >}}) *by Richard Bushman, and I'm comparing what the two cover. Interesting things that appear in both books might be covered here or there.*

## chapter 1

It was interesting to learn that when Joseph Smith, Sr., moved his family to New York, they were buying in at the height of speculation over the newly proposed Erie Canal, which was set to run right through Palmyra. Palmyra's population actually never grew much after 1817 when they moved.

Joseph's atmosphere growing up in Palmyra was optimistic (due to the Erie Canal and general westward expansion), patriotic, and full of religious fervor. There were plenty of weird revelatory or communistic groups that were developing in the area, and "the sober preacher trained in the dialetics of the seminary was rare west of the Appalachians."

## chapter 2

*Rough stone rolling* doesn't spend much time on Joseph's youth, other than to describe the official narrative provided by Joseph's later autobiography. Here Brodie gives us a glimpse at what we can see of Joseph's young years through some documents. Here are the interesting notes:

- (1819, 1822, 1851) Indian burial mounds and relics were common in western New York and Ohio. Apparently there were eight burial mounds discovered "within twelve miles of the Smith farm."
- (date unclear) Joseph discovers a seer stone in a well he was digging for Mason Chase.
- (March 1826) Joseph is convicted of being "a disorderly person and an impostor" in Bainbridge, New York. Joseph testified that "he had a certain stone, which he had occasionally looked at to determine where hidden treasures in the bowels of the earth were; that he professed to tell in this manner where gold-mines were a distance under ground, and had looked for Mr. Stowel several times, and informed him where he could find those treasures, and Mr. Stowel had been engaged in digging for them; that at Palmyra he pretended to tell, by looking at this stone, where coined money was buried in Pennsylvania, and while at Palmyra he had frequently ascertained in that way where lost property was, of various kinds; that he had occasionally been in the habit of looking through this stone to find lost property for three years, but of late had pretty much given it up on account of its injuring his health, especially his eyes---made them sore; that he did not solicit business of this kind, and had always rather declined having anything to do with this business." Joseph appears to have given up treasure digging after this trial.
- (1827) Joseph marries Emma Hale against the wishes of her father, and eight months later they return to her father for some of her possessions and to confront her father. Joseph hired Peter Ingersoll to drive them, and Ingersoll recounts that Joseph admitted to never being able to see in a stone, and promised to "give up his old habits of digging for money and looking into stones".
- (1830-1) A press account describing a "vagabond fortune-teller" named Walters notes that when he left the area "his mantle fell upon young Joseph Smith."
- (1859) Martin Harris states in in a newspaper that Josiah Stowel; Joseph Smith, Jr.; Joseph Smith, Sr.; Hiram Smith; and others were involved in money-digging in Palmyra, Manchester, Pennsylvania, and other places.
- ("later years") Joseph admits to having been a money-digger, but denies the hocus-pocus his neighbors attribute to him and states that he got "only fourteen dollars a month for it." Here he's referring to what Josiah Stowel paid him when he searched for treasure for several months in Pennsylvania.

Brodie recounts Joseph's autobiographical telling of the First Vision experience (written in 1838), including the part where Joseph states that he received "a great deal of prejudice against me among professors of religion" for telling the story of this vision. Surprisingly, there are no accounts in Palmyra newspapers of this story, even though they were always quick to speak negatively of him later in life. In 1831 one journalist even insisted that Joseph "never made any serious pretentions to religion until his late pretended revelation [the discovery of the Book of Mormon]," and that "it is well known that Joe Smith never pretended to have any communion with angels until a long period after the pretended finding of his book."

I think Brodie makes her point most clearly here: "Joseph's first published autobiographical sketch of 1834, already noted, contained no whisper of an event that, if it had happened, would have been the most soul-shattering experience of his whole youth." The accounts that we do have grow progressively in detail and theological importance. Brodie thinks the later accounts were "probably the elaboration of some half-remembered dream stimulated by the early revival excitement and reinforced by the rich folklore of visions circulating in his neighborhood. Or it may have been some sheer invention."

Another interesting note from a neighbor: "Joseph had a little ambition, and some very laudable aspirations; his mother's intellect shone out in him feebly, especially when he used to help us solve some portentous questions of moral or political ethics in our juvenile debating club ... And subsequently, after catching a spark of Methodism in the camp meeting, away down in the woods, on the Vienna road, he was a very passable exhorter in the evening meetings."
