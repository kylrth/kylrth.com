*I'm reading this book at the same time as* [Joseph Smith: rough stone rolling]({{< relref "no-man-knows.md" >}}) *by Richard Bushman, and I'm comparing what the two cover. Interesting things that appear in both books might be covered here or there.*

## chapter 1

It was interesting to learn that when Joseph Smith, Sr., moved his family to New York, they were buying in at the height of speculation over the newly proposed Erie Canal, which was set to run right through Palmyra. Palmyra's population actually never grew much after 1817 when they moved.

Joseph's atmosphere growing up in Palmyra was optimistic (due to the Erie Canal and general westward expansion), patriotic, and full of religious fervor. There were plenty of weird revelatory or communistic groups that were developing in the area, and "the sober preacher trained in the dialetics of the seminary was rare west of the Appalachians."

## chapter 2

*Rough stone rolling* doesn't spend much time on Joseph's youth, other than to describe the official narrative provided by Joseph's later autobiography. Here Brodie gives us a glimpse at what we can see of Joseph's young years through some documents. Here are the interesting notes:

- (1819, 1822, 1851) Indian burial mounds and relics were common in western New York and Ohio. Apparently there were eight burial mounds discovered "within twelve miles of the Smith farm."
- (1822, thanks Bushman) Joseph discovers a seer stone in a well he was digging for Mason Chase.
- (March 1826) Joseph is convicted of being "a disorderly person and an impostor" in Bainbridge, New York. Joseph testified that "he had a certain stone, which he had occasionally looked at to determine where hidden treasures in the bowels of the earth were; that he professed to tell in this manner where gold-mines were a distance under ground, and had looked for Mr. Stowel several times, and informed him where he could find those treasures, and Mr. Stowel had been engaged in digging for them; that at Palmyra he pretended to tell, by looking at this stone, where coined money was buried in Pennsylvania, and while at Palmyra he had frequently ascertained in that way where lost property was, of various kinds; that he had occasionally been in the habit of looking through this stone to find lost property for three years, but of late had pretty much given it up on account of its injuring his health, especially his eyes---made them sore; that he did not solicit business of this kind, and had always rather declined having anything to do with this business." Joseph appears to have given up treasure digging after this trial.
- (1827) Joseph marries Emma Hale against the wishes of her father, and eight months later they return to her father for some of her possessions and to confront her father. Joseph hired Peter Ingersoll to drive them, and Ingersoll recounts that Joseph admitted to never being able to see in a stone, and promised to "give up his old habits of digging for money and looking into stones".
- (1827) Joseph obtains the gold plates.
- (1830-1) A press account describing a "vagabond fortune-teller" named Walters notes that when he left the area "his mantle fell upon young Joseph Smith."
- (1859) Martin Harris states in in a newspaper that Josiah Stowel; Joseph Smith, Jr.; Joseph Smith, Sr.; Hiram Smith; and others were involved in money-digging in Palmyra, Manchester, Pennsylvania, and other places.
- ("later years") Joseph admits to having been a money-digger, but denies the hocus-pocus his neighbors attribute to him and states that he got "only fourteen dollars a month for it." Here he's referring to what Josiah Stowel paid him when he searched for treasure for several months in Pennsylvania.

Brodie recounts Joseph's autobiographical telling of the First Vision experience (written in 1838), including the part where Joseph states that he received "a great deal of prejudice against me among professors of religion" for telling the story of this vision. Surprisingly, there are no accounts in Palmyra newspapers of this story, even though they were always quick to speak negatively of him later in life. In 1831 one journalist even insisted that Joseph "never made any serious pretentions to religion until his late pretended revelation [the discovery of the Book of Mormon]," and that "it is well known that Joe Smith never pretended to have any communion with angels until a long period after the pretended finding of his book."

I think Brodie makes her point most clearly here: "Joseph's first published autobiographical sketch of 1834, already noted, contained no whisper of an event that, if it had happened, would have been the most soul-shattering experience of his whole youth." The accounts that we do have grow progressively in detail and theological importance. Brodie thinks the later accounts were "probably the elaboration of some half-remembered dream stimulated by the early revival excitement and reinforced by the rich folklore of visions circulating in his neighborhood. Or it may have been some sheer invention."

Another interesting note from a neighbor: "Joseph had a little ambition, and some very laudable aspirations; his mother's intellect shone out in him feebly, especially when he used to help us solve some portentous questions of moral or political ethics in our juvenile debating club ... And subsequently, after catching a spark of Methodism in the camp meeting, away down in the woods, on the Vienna road, he was a very passable exhorter in the evening meetings."

## chapter 3

Brodie documents some accounts of the time that demonstrated the common belief that the Moundbuilders had been more advanced than the Iroquois and were killed in a great slaughter. For example, "William Henry Harrison, shortly before his election to the Presidency, wrote that the last great battle took place on the banks of the Ohio, where 'a feeble band was collected, remnant of mighty battles fought in vain, to make a last effort for the country of their birth, the ashes of their ancestors and the altars of their gods.'"

Here are some important events demonstrating Joseph's exposure to and interest in the Moundbuilder lore:

- (before Nov 1823) Joseph gives imaginative descriptions of the Moundbuilder people to his family for entertainment.
- (1827) Joseph mentions to Peter Ingersoll that someone in Canada had found a history of the Indians at the base of a hollow tree. This discovery was mentioned in a Palmyra newspaper in 1821.
- (Sept 22, 1827) According to Lucy Smith, Joseph and Emma bring the plates, Urim and Thummim, and breastplate home, and show all but the plates to Lucy.

Lucy told a few stories of hijinks where a diviner and a glass-looker both divined the location of the plates, but Joseph was able to remove them just in time.

## chapter 4

The first 116 pages were really slow, less than two pages a day. The scribes used no punctuation, so the typesetters broke up clauses as they saw fit. Of the first 200 sentences, 140 started with "And."

Brodie says that when Harris lost the 116 pages he was already too far invested in the tale: Emma and Martin trusted his story, Isaac Hale would hate him, and his family needed the money from the sales. Brodie thinks this is a turning point for Joseph. He doubled down on the story, got a revelation through the Urim and Thummim to help him continue the work, and this time the work would be religious in nature, rather than just an Indian political history.

By the time they resumed writing, it had been a year since Joseph had gotten the plates.
The harsh anti-Catholic rhetoric in the beginning of the BoM is reflective of some anti-Catholic sentiment that existed in the area due to an influx of Irish labor for the Erie Canal.

Brodie points out that Lucy likely did not borrow Joseph Sr's vision of the tree from the Book of Mormon, since she also recounts five other dreams of his in detail.

Oliver Cowdery "had seasons of skepticism, in which I did seriously wonder whether the prophet and I were men in our sober senses when we would be translating from plates through 'the Urim and Thummim' and the plates not be in sight at all."

David Whitmer: "At times, when Brother Joseph would attempt to translate, he would look into the hat in which the stone was placed, he found that he was spiritually blind and could not translate. He told us that his mind dwelt too much on earthly things, and various causes would make him incapable of proceeding with the translation. When in this condition he would go out and pray; and when he became sufficiently humble before God, he could then proceed with the translation."

Despite the fact that the early pages of the first complete manuscript are written in Oliver's hand, Harris maintains that he recorded as much as a third of the book. It's possible that Oliver copied the pages Harris had already translated.

> His talent, it is true, was not exceptional, for his book lacked subtlety, wit, and style. He was chiefly a tale-teller and preacher. His characters were pale, humorless stereotypes; the prophets were always holy, and in three thousand years of history not a single harlot was made to speak. But he began the book with a first-class murder, added assassinations, and piled up battles by the score. There was plenty of bloodshed and slaughter to make up for the lack of gaiety and the stuff of humanity.

One thing Brodie's explanation of the book of Mormon doesn't account for are the backreferences made in the book. That would be very difficult when dictating from memory.

Stories copied from the Bible:

- Salome and the daughter of Jared both danced before a king and brought about a decapitation.
- Aminadi and Daniel both deciphered handwriting on a wall.
- Alma and Paul were converted in basically the same way.
- The daughters of the Lamanites and the daughters of Shiloh were all abducted while dancing.
- Ammon and David both killed enemies with a sling.

Joseph was writing the BoM exactly in the middle of some tremendous anti-Mason fervor. It has sparked around a murder in western New York, and eventually involved presidential candidate Andrew Jackson, who was a high-ranking Mason.

## chapter 5

> It is easy enough to deride its style, and painstaking research can uncover the sources of all its ideas. But nothing can detract from the fact that many people have found it convincing history.

Brodie says the story of Ether answers the question of the origin of animals in the New World.

Joseph was one of the most charismatic people in American history, according to Brodie. Cowdery referred to his "mysterious power, which even now I fail to fathom." He was also a talented leader, and could make people see visions.

Fawn Brodie thinks Joseph's talent was for hypnosis. The local press reported different accounts from each of the three witnesses, which leads her to believe that the witnesses weren't confederate but tricked.

- Harris's account was that he saw the plates with the eye of faith, though covered with a cloth. Then later in life he said he saw the angel turn the pages of the plates in front of him.
- David Whitmer said Joseph led him to an open field where the plates were lying open on the ground, but later in life included a table and an angel and all the related objects (sword, Liahona, etc.).

Fawn Brodie thinks hypnosis might have been involved. But the craziest thing to her is that Joseph acted and sounded more and more believing over time, rather than more cynical as you might expect from a trickster.

On the subject of selling the copyright in Canada, Brodie shares that when Cowdery and Page returned from Toronto without success, Joseph told them that some revelations are from man and come from his carnal desires.

## chapter 6

Brodie quotes Lehi in saying that a dream is equivalent to a vision. She thinks Joseph's concept of dreams/visions/reality was very fluid.

Brodie related a few stories that show us how Joseph interfaced with his young congregation as a prophet of God:

- He convinced Martin Harris that Jesus had walked through the room while he was preaching, but the people hadn't been prepared to see him.
- Joseph healed Newel Knight from a devil that was plaguing him, probably over concern for his sins.

The first story demonstrates Joseph's ability to spin convincing experiences for his converts, and the second demonstrates how an experience like exorcism (common in this time period) might have simultaneously increased Joseph's confidence in his own authority.

Emma wasn't baptized until six weeks after the founding of the church, and she especially struggled when Joseph received the revelation to leave behind his "temporal labors" and seek support from the church.

## chapter 7

Joseph's enamor with Rigdon hurt the feelings of others, especially when the revelation asked the church to uproot and move to Ohio.

The main components of Joseph's church in this period were lay preaching, authoritarianism, millennialism, and communalism.

Joseph's first action in Ohio was basically to end the revivalist spirits and tongues in the church. This was not a revivalist sect, and Joseph appealed to reason as much as emotion. This gave Mormonism an intellectual appeal that would draw from a broader class of people than those who joined cults.

Joseph blessed Lyman Johnson, William Smith (his brother), and Orson Hyde with the promise that they would see the Savior come, and stand on earth until then.

The exodus to Missouri was precipitated by two events: his failure to heal several people at a conference, and the retraction of the offer of land that the New York church members were going to use as a part of the United Order.

## chapter 8

Joseph saw in a vision "hundreds of converts awaiting them in Zion", but when they got there there were only three or four women in the Mormon colony. "Edward Partridge, who had been given control of the United Order in the new Zion. complained about the quality of the land selected for purchase. When Joseph replied with some heat that Heaven had selected the land, Partridge replied pointedly: 'I wish you not to tell us any more that you know these things by the spirit when you do not; you told us that Oliver had raised up a large church here, and there is no such thing.'" Rigdon urged Joseph to return to Ohio, and not wanting to lose him Joseph agreed, thus splitting the Mormons into the Missouri colony and the Kirtland colony.

The Missouri United Order did a lot better than the Kirtland Order, because the Missouri Saints were more often penniless whereas there was more economic disparity in Kirtland to start. The Kirtland Order started making progress once it took out a $10,000 loan, which revelation said the Missouri Order would pay if the debt got out of hand.

During that winter, Joseph left the United Order to others and focused on the Bible translation and on preparing his revelations for publication. To his Bible translation he added sections prophesying his own prophethood and elaborating the section of Isaiah about the learned man and the sealed book. His efforts with the Bible led to some of his most prolific revelation writing, including D&C 76 which differed prominently from the fire and brimstone theology preached in the Book of Mormon.

The only violence against the Mormons in Ohio was when some disaffected Mormons tarred and feathered Joseph in the night. This is that story where Joseph preached a sermon the next morning, all covered in scars and bruises, but didn't call anyone out.

Joseph headed to Missouri to quell the Missouri saints' frustrations about the United Order debt and other decisions being made without their vote or help. All three of the original witnesses were living there, but without major roles in the church. While there, Joseph and Sidney relieved tensions by setting up a nine-man board over both branches of the United Order and holding an election where Joseph was unanimously elected president of the church.

After that, the Missouri group doubled in size. They were still poor, but they had unity. They struggled with the wealthier converts not being as willing to enter the United Order, and with apostatizing members sueing the Order for their property (and usually winning).

Brodie sees Joseph's trip to New York as the beginning of his concern for wider world affairs. She also sees him begin to really fill out in his role as prophet over an expanding church.

Joseph's revelation about South Carolina starting a civil war was given the first time South Carolina threatened seccession, 30 years before the actual civil war. It also said that that war would expand to include all nations.

Joseph started the construction of the Kirtland temple, and soon after sent a revelation for the Missouri saints to begin building their temple, on threat of divine condemnation. But just at that time, Missourians had destroyed the Saints' printing press, "tarred and feathered Bishop Partridge, and ordered the whole colony to leave the county."
