*I'm reading this book at the same time as* [Joseph Smith: rough stone rolling]({{< relref "no-man-knows.md" >}}) *by Richard Bushman, and I'm comparing what the two cover. Interesting things that appear in both books might be covered here or there.*

## chapter xx

It was interesting to learn that when Joseph Smith, Sr., moved his family to New York, they were buying in at the height of speculation over the newly proposed Erie Canal, which was set to run right through Palmyra. Palmyra's population actually never grew much after 1817 when they moved.

Joseph's atmosphere growing up in Palmyra was optimistic (due to the Erie Canal and general westward expansion), patriotic, and full of religious fervor. There were plenty of weird revelatory or communistic groups that were developing in the area, and "the sober preacher trained in the dialetics of the seminary was rare west of the Appalachians."
