This book was published in 2007, before the Great Recession. It definitely reads that way. Very capitalist, very Christian, very neo-liberal.

I enjoyed learning more about Adam Smith. I feel like Skousen does a good job painting the importance of his ideas as an invention that drove the Industrial Revolution.

According to Skousen, Marx is the devil incarnate, and his ideas are a dangerous disease infecting the minds of intellectuals and workers. Skousen takes a strange interest in painting Marx and Keynes as deranged, sexual deviants, etc. ("The Truth about Keynes' Homosexuality" is a section in this book.)

Skousen treats economics as a mostly solved science, and argues constantly that Marxism is essentially dead, only kept on life support by "sociologists, anthropologists, literary theorists", and other cronies.

I really appreciate understanding where all the economic schools come from and how they differ:

- **classical school** (Adam Smith): a free market allows for division of labor by way of the invisible hand
- **Marxian school**: invented the word capitalism, pointed out the class conflict and exploitation inherent to using capital to organize labor
- **neoclassical school**: solved the problem of relative subjective utility, which explained how demand sets prices
- **monetarist school**: inflation is caused by the expansion of credit; if the money supply doubles, prices will double; thus inflation of the money supply is not a big problem
- **Austrian school**: money is non-neutral and can be viewed as a commodity, and inflation can cause instability
- **Cambridge school** (Keynes): public investment can stave off the effects of the business cycle

I'll finish it off with this quote from the conclusion:

> Competition within an industry is not necessarily reduced when it is limited to only a few large companies. ... Competition is strong even among only a few large firms. Monopolistic firms tend to keep prices competitive because of the ever-present threat of entry by other large firms. The world is "as if" fully competitive.

That should give you a good impression of the slant we get from Skousen.
