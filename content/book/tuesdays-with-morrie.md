- The most important things in life are the things we feel and the relationships we have.
- The best work is to influence others: to be someone's favorite teacher or best friend. "I've never had another _______ like you."
- Share talents and words with others in sincere ways
- Do the best you can to do what you want to do, but forgive yourself when you don't do something.
- Read poetry and see art.
