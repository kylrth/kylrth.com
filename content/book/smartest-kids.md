The PISA test tests common senses reasoning. The countries that did best on the test were a surprise to everyone.

We talk a lot about parent involvement but we do pretty well in the US with that. It turns out it's not very correlated with success. We create narratives (poor kids, bad family situation, etc.) to explain why schools are less successful, and that idea is attractive and sticks around even if it isn't true. The poor family situation story isn't true because of New Hampshire and Finland.

In the US we have lots of superintendents over small school districts, so there's a lot of overhead without much benefit.

South Korean kids are successful on PISA. The Korean school system is spoken well of throughout the world, except in South Korea where everyone feels like there's too much pressure. The kids are unhappy and unproductive during public school hours (they learn more in private school at night).

Authoritative vs authoritarian vs permissive parents.

In America we have the belief that there are people who are good at math and bad at math, whereas we think everyone ought to become good at reading.
