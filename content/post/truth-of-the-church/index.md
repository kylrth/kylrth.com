I have undergone a faith transition. It started very suddenly one day after discovering some information about church history online. Very early on as I studied I knew I needed to record my evidence and conclusions somewhere, and this post has grown out of that document. There are a few things I want to keep in mind as I write here:

- In all my reading, studying, and thinking since that moment, I've noticed that there is a *lot* of information out there, and it tends to be dumped together all at once as "unequivocal proof" that the church is false. If you add up all of these unlikelihoods, the argument goes, it becomes impossible for the church to be directed by God. This can end up overwhelming reason in a sort of [*argumentum ad nauseam*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof_by_assertion): if you discover that one argument against the church isn't really strong enough to be a problem for you, the attacker can say that that particular argument isn't necessary to support the conclusion because there are all these other arguments. I want to record the facts that lead me to believe that the church is not what it says it is, but I want to narrow it down to just the most compelling issues to make sure I'm not succumbing to *argumentum ad nauseam*.
- I'll only say things I can back up with reachable, trustable sources. When I say reachable, I mean that you don't have to leave your computer to find them. By trustable, I mean sources that can't easily be made out to be anti-Mormon lies.  Here are examples of trustable sources:
  - the source text of the revelatory productions of Joseph Smith
  - journals, letters, and other materials produced by people who were present (as a primary source for that person's beliefs and experiences)
  - [gospel topics essays](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/manual/gospel-topics/essays?lang=eng) and [general conference talks](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/general-conference?lang=eng)
  - scholarly publications describing research experiments, or scholarly discussion with references to the actual experiments
  - the words of people who are sharing their beliefs and experiences (as a primary source for discussion of beliefs and experiences)

  I am also willing to cite secondary sources when they compile information from primary sources that are generally reachable and trustable too.
- Church leaders have [often](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/general-conference/2021/04/49nelson?lang=eng) [asked](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/general-conference/2018/10/truth-and-the-plan?lang=eng) us to stick to church-approved sources and arguments when looking at church history. I'm not going to do that, because to only listen to accounts from those who are faithful would be [survivorship bias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survivorship_bias). But if, as the church suggests, Satan has put in the hearts of the enemies of the church to create anti-Mormon lies, they will either be lies about facts (i.e. false accounts) or false argumentation. Shady facts can be handled by comparing several accounts and considering the context of the person writing, and shady argumentation can be handled by watching for fallacies and reading both sides of the argument.

In publishing this to a broader audience than just myself, my point is not to disparage the church or the good that it does. I am also not trying to scare believers out of the church with surprising facts. Here is what I hope to demonstrate:

- The Book of Mormon is likely not an ancient document because
  - it contains borrowed ideas and text that did not exist until after Moroni is supposed to have buried the record in 400 CE, and
  - its story is not plausible when compared with data that we do have about ancient America.
- The other revelatory productions of Joseph Smith are most easily explained as [pseudepigrapha](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudepigrapha) rather than authentic translations or revelations.
- The method for determining that the church is true (i.e. "Moroni's Promise") functions by the same method that convinces other religious people of their respective beliefs.
- The church's method for receiving revelation is faulty because prophets have claimed to be speaking for God when proclaiming doctrine and principles which were later recanted by the church. This leaves us without a way to reliably determine what God wants us to think when facing modern problems.
- The church is full of "philosophies of men" and prizes obedience more highly than morality.

Like I said earlier, this doesn't contain every single reason not to believe the church's exceptional claims, but these are what I think are the strongest reasons.

## inclusions of KJV text in the Book of Mormon

Of the 6604 verses in the 1830 edition of the Book of Mormon ([source](https://github.com/wordtreefoundation/bomdb#align-a-new-book-of-mormon-text-file)), 581 are direct quotations from the KJV Bible and 442 borrow phrases found in the KJV (counting from [this list](http://web.archive.org/web/20201027171536/http://bookofmormondepot.com/kjv-verses/) using `grep -o 'tr class="vq"' bom.html | wc -l` and `grep -o 'tr class="vp"' bom.html | wc -l` respectively). Many of these quotations are problematic because they demonstrate that the author(s) of the Book of Mormon had access to the King James Version of the Bible, which was published in 1611.

A great example of this problem is [1 Nephi 1:14](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/1.14#14), which uses the phrase "Great and marvelous are thy works, O Lord God Almighty!". This exact phrase is used in [Revelation 15:3](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/rev/15.3#3), about 700 years after Lehi uses it. Similarly, both [1 Nephi 13:27](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/13.27#27) and [Acts 13:10](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/acts/13.10#10) use the phrase "pervert the right ways of the Lord". Those two phrases could have both appeared by coincidence, but many of the 440 other borrowings are similarly surprising. This implies that the English version of the Book of Mormon was heavily influenced by the exact wording of the KJV.

More evidence of this is found if we look at the chapters quoted from the Bible. The chapters don't appear *exactly* verbatim; there is a pattern of minor differences that is pretty consistent throughout the quoted chapters. Often, the italicized words in the KJV are removed in the BoM when the sentence can make sense without them. A good example of this is [2 Nephi 24:32](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/24.32#32) and [Isaiah 14:32](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/isa/14.32#32): "What shall *one* then answer the messengers of the nations?" is converted to "What shall then answer the messengers of the nations?", which changes "messengers" into the subject instead of the object of the sentence. Italicized words are removed approximately 40 times more often than non-italicized words ([source](https://web.archive.org/web/20210213130210/https://journal.interpreterfoundation.org/missing-words-king-james-bible-italics-the-translation-of-the-book-of-mormon-and-joseph-smith-as-an-unlearned-reader/), p. 53). These don't look like corrections that demonstrate a more accurate, original version of the Isaiah text, but rather they demonstrate a 19th century understanding of "Bible errors". The common view at the time was that "the old and new testaments are filled with errors, obscurities, **italics** and contradictions, which must be the work of men" (from *The Evening and the Morning Star* in 1833 as cited [here](https://web.archive.org/web/20210213130210/https://journal.interpreterfoundation.org/missing-words-king-james-bible-italics-the-translation-of-the-book-of-mormon-and-joseph-smith-as-an-unlearned-reader/), p. 58; emphasis mine).

The [article](https://web.archive.org/web/20210213130210/https://journal.interpreterfoundation.org/missing-words-king-james-bible-italics-the-translation-of-the-book-of-mormon-and-joseph-smith-as-an-unlearned-reader/) cited above (from the Interpreter Foundation) argues that the differences between the Book of Mormon and KJV point to Joseph reading (through the seer stone) a version of the KJV with the italicized words removed, but why would God show Joseph such a translation when we know now that nearly all cases of italicized words reflect a better interpretation of the Bible in English? The article argues that *not* removing the italicized words would have confused 19th-century readers who believed the italics were problematic. But the Book of Mormon claims the Bible has lost "many parts which are plain and most precious" ([1 Nephi 13:26](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/13.26#26)) and its express purpose is to restore those truths (see [1 Nephi 13:34-36](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/13.34-36#34)). Instead of adding errors to the quoted Bible passages to adapt for 19th-century readers' intellectual ease, you'd think God would have taken the opportunity to provide a more accurate translation, or at least not worse than the KJV.

### one example in 2 Nephi 12:16

One really good example where the Book of Mormon gets it wrong is 2 Nephi 12:16:

- Isaiah 2:16 (NRSV): against all the ships of Tarshish, and against all the beautiful craft.
- Isaiah 2:16 (KJV): And upon all the ships of Tarshish, and upon all pleasant pictures.
- 2 Nephi 12:16: And upon all the ships of the sea, and upon all the ships of Tarshish, and upon all pleasant pictures.

Biblical scholars agree that the KJV use of the word "pictures" is a mistranslation ([source](https://web.archive.org/web/20200709051157/https://scholarsarchive.byu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1377&context=jbms), p. 17-19), but that word appears in the Book of Mormon. The added phrase about "ships of the sea" doesn't work either. This chapter is written in *verse*, meaning that in Hebrew these were actually poetic couplets. Having both phrases there messes up the meter and meaning of the poetic couplets ([source](https://web.archive.org/web/20200709051157/https://scholarsarchive.byu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1377&context=jbms), p. 16). Despite the issue with the meter, it could be that having the two phrases about "ships of Tarshish/the sea" is the original, and a copying error was made between the time when Nephi got the brass plates (600 BC) and when the Dead Sea scrolls were produced (ca. 125 BC ([source](http://dss.collections.imj.org.il/isaiah))). (The authors of the above [source](https://web.archive.org/web/20200709051157/https://scholarsarchive.byu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1377&context=jbms) posit that the line "and upon all pleasant pictures" could be a concluding line that pairs with the introductory line added in the Book of Mormon in verse 13 [p. 24]. But it seems highly unlikely that those distant paired lines would *both* be lost due to a copying error.) Now, consider these two bits of information in tandem:

1. The issue with "pictures" seems to imply that Joseph was either copying directly from the King James Bible or God was giving him some version of the text close to the KJV, including errors.
1. The fact that 2 Nephi 12:16 includes both phrases about ships means that God was either providing incorrect changes to the text or in fact providing the original text, but was unwilling to correct the problem with "pictures".

### other examples

Similar issues occur all over the Book of Mormon and demonstrate that Joseph was working from the KJV:

- Slight changes to paraphrased text reflect a misunderstanding of KJV grammar, e.g. [2 Nephi 15:4](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/15.4#4)'s use of "wherefore" as an introduction rather than a question word as it is used in the KJV [Isaiah 5:4](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/isa/5.4#4). (The punctuation in the Book of Mormon was added by the printer ([source](https://web.archive.org/web/20210122043157/https://history.churchofjesuschrist.org/content/museum/the-book-of-mormon-from-manuscript-to-press?lang=eng)), but "it" and "brought" swap places to change the question into a statement.)
- Jesus' Sermon at the Temple is clearly modified from the King James Version of the Sermon on the Mount in Matthew.
  - "Raca" is Aramaic, not Hebrew, so it shouldn't appear *in Aramaic* in [3 Nephi 12:22](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/12.22#22) because the Nephites wouldn't have been culturally familiar with Aramaic. It seems unlikely that this specific word was brought to America by Lehi and his family and remained unaltered for 600 years, or that the best translation of the Nephite word Jesus used was the Aramaic word "raca".
  - "Farthing" is changed to "senine" in [3 Nephi 12:26](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/12.26#26) but "compel thee to go a mile" is retained in [v. 41](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/12.41#41) despite the Nephites not being familiar with the mile (a Roman unit of distance).
  - The phrase "by them of old time" is problematic in [3 Nephi 12:27](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/12.27#27):

    - Matthew 5:27 (NRSV): You have heard that it was said, "You shall not commit adultery."
    - Matthew 5:27 (KJV): You have heard that it was said *by them of old time*, Thou shalt not commit adultery:
    - Matthew 5:27 (NKJV): You have heard that it was said *to those of old*, 'You shall not commit adultery.'
    - 3 Nephi 12:27: Behold, it is written *by them of old time*, that thou shalt not commit adultery;

    In the KJV this English phrase is translated from *τοῖς ἀρχαίοις* (*tois archaiois*), which is not present in the early manuscripts of the Greek New Testament. Furthermore, the KJV mistranslates this as "*by* them of old time" when it would really be "*to* them of old time". This is reflected in the New King James Version above. So the Book of Mormon contains a piece of text borrowed from the KJV that was likely not in the original sermon and was *definitely* mistranslated.

- For a multitude of reasons, scholars are virtually unanimous ([source](https://web.archive.org/web/20210327175123/https://ca.thegospelcoalition.org/columns/ad-fontes/what-do-you-do-with-the-end-of-marks-gospel/)) in the belief that [Mark 16:9-20](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/mark/16.9-20#9) (the "long ending of Mark") was added later and was not in the original text of the book of Mark. Yet we find most of [Mark 16:15-18](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/mark/16.15-18#15) quoted verbatim in [Mormon 9:22-24](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/morm/9.22-24#22).

Each one of these issues, taken in isolation, could be explained away by saying that current research is wrong, or by arguing that something else happened to either the Nephite text or the Bible text. But combined together, you'd have to say that a lot of biblical research is incorrect or that a lot of unlikely things happened for the texts to appear as they do. It's much more reasonable to conclude that the King James Version of the Bible was a source text for the Book of Mormon.

- This [article](https://web.archive.org/web/20210202044338/https://rsc.byu.edu/isaiah-prophets/isaiah-variants-book-mormon) goes through differences between the KJV and Book of Mormon text, but tends to oversimplify issues and err on the side of support for the Book of Mormon in many cases. You can observe this by comparing his commentary on 2 Nephi 24:32 and 1 Nephi 20:11 with this [side-by-side English translation](http://dss.collections.imj.org.il/chapters_pg) of the Masoretic text and the Great Isaiah Scroll (IQIsa) from the Dead Sea scrolls.

- One prominent issue I did not discuss is the inclusion of Duetero-Isaiah text in the Book of Mormon. All mainstream biblical scholars agree that Isaiah 40-66 was written after the Babylonian exile by someone else, meaning that text wouldn't have been available to Lehi and his family when they left for the New World.

## historicity of the Book of Mormon narrative

The story in the Book of Mormon is of epic proportions: there are dozens of cities, several temples, people who miraculously convert by the thousands, and tens of thousands who die in brutal wars. The wars are especially dramatic and long-lasting: not forty years from when Lehi's family arrived in America, they "had already had wars and contentions with [their] brethren" ([2 Nephi 5:34](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/5.34#34)), and that continued with only short periods of peace except for a few hundred years after Jesus' visit (see [4 Nephi 1](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/4-ne/1), especially [v. 35-36, 47](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/4-ne/1.35-36,47#35)). These wars culminate in the death of at least 230,000 Nephites around 385 CE (see [Mormon 6:10-15](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/morm/6.10-15#10)). The Nephites had agriculture ([Mosiah 9:9](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/9.9#9)), metallurgy ([2 Nephi 5:15](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/5.15#15)), and ship building ([Alma 63:4-7](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/63.4-7#4)). Despite their generally larger population, for much of the timeline of the Book of Mormon the Lamanites appear to have been mostly hunter-gatherers with some cities later (see [Enos 1:20](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/enos/1.20#20), [2 Nephi 5:22-24](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/5.22-24#22), [Alma 22:28](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/22.28#28), and [Alma 23:2-15](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/23.2-15#2)).

There are several issues with how these nations functioned that I'll address below.

### population growth

For most of pre-agricultural history, the growth rate of the human world population was negligible. The agricultural revolution greatly improved the growth rate because it provided a more stable and land-dense source of food. Kunich notes that by the time of Jesus the world population had reached 200-400 million and the growth rate was around 0.04% ([source](http://signaturebookslibrary.org/new-approaches-to-the-book-of-mormon-07/), p. 240; see the book sources he cites using these links: [Brown](https://web.archive.org/web/20200711175343/https://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/ED153893.pdf), [Catton](https://archive.org/details/overshootecologi00catt)). Because of a multitude of new processes and technologies, in the last 200 years that growth rate has increased dramatically, reaching 2.0% in 1960 (see Table 2 [here](http://signaturebookslibrary.org/new-approaches-to-the-book-of-mormon-07/) and the [estimates](https://www.census.gov/data/tables/time-series/demo/international-programs/historical-est-worldpop.html) compiled by the US Census Bureau). The rate has decreased since then as the population levels off, so 2.0% represents the fastest that the world population has ever grown.

The picture that the Book of Mormon paints is of two massive and successful Bronze-age civilizations, but reasonable population growth does not support this scale. Examine Table 3 from [Kunich](http://signaturebookslibrary.org/new-approaches-to-the-book-of-mormon-07/) (p. 250), which shows how Book of Mormon populations would have grown under growth rates ranging from 0.04% (reasonable for agricultural societies) to 2.0% (the peak global population growth seen in the 1960s). Remember, the growth rate includes the deaths caused by war (see Table 4 from [Kunich](http://signaturebookslibrary.org/new-approaches-to-the-book-of-mormon-07/) p. 254), disease (see [Alma 46:40-41](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/46.40-41#40)), and natural disasters (see [3 Nephi 8-10](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/8); note that [3 Nephi 8:9-10,14-15](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/8.9-10,14-15#9) says many cities were completely destroyed). A 2.0% or even 3.0% growth rate might have been possible for certain exceptional periods ([Kunich](http://signaturebookslibrary.org/new-approaches-to-the-book-of-mormon-07/), p. 244), but it is not reasonable to expect anything close to that for most of Nephite history ([Kunich](http://signaturebookslibrary.org/new-approaches-to-the-book-of-mormon-07/), p. 246-259).

Let's see what happens when we allow as much of a growth rate as is reasonable:

| year elapsed / date | growth rate up to that date `\((r)\)` | estimated population `\(\bigl(N_n=N_{n-1}e^{rt}\bigr)\)` | reasoning |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 0 / 590 BC | 0.0% | 30 | 20 people is supported by scripture; 30 is generous ([Kunich](http://signaturebookslibrary.org/new-approaches-to-the-book-of-mormon-07/), p. 246)
| 100 / 490 BC | 3.0% | 603 | initial expansion into unclaimed promised land may have allowed for rapid growth |
| 430 / 160 BC | 0.2% | 1,166 | mixed hunter-gatherer/agrarian society and continual wars until King Mosiah ([Enos 1:20-24](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/enos/1.20-24#20); [Omni 1:3,5,17](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/omni/1.3,5,17#3); [Mosiah 1:1](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/1.1#1); [Mosiah 9:18-19](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/9.18-19#18), [10:20](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/10.20#20)); generously multiplying the post-Agricultural Revolution average (0.04%) by five |

By this point there is already a problem. Around 187 BC the people of Limhi kill 3043 Lamanites (with 279 of their own dead), and then kill at least that many again (see [Mosiah 9:18-19](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/9.18-19#18), [10:20](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/10.20#20)). I'll quote from Kunich again:

> Obviously the total Book of Mormon population at that time was much larger than 3,322 because numerous warriors were left alive after the battle as were women and male noncombatants. But even to produce a total population as large as the fatality figures for this one day would have required an average annual growth rate of 1.2 percent during the preceding four centuries. To put this into perspective, a growth rate of 1.2 percent was never achieved on a global basis or in the industrialized regions of the world as a whole until 1950-60 C.E. and was not reached in the developing regions as a whole until the 1930s (Bogue 1969, 48-49). The Nephite-Lehite rate is thirty times the rate that existed in the world as a whole during the same era. Moreover if, as is far more likely [according to the numbers of dead mentioned in these Limhite wars], the total population in 187 B.C. was in excess of 35,000, it would have taken an average annual growth rate of 1.8 percent to multiply the original thirty pioneers to that level at that time. This is a rate that has never been reached in the industrialized world and has only been achieved in the world overall since 1950 (see Table 2). ([source](http://signaturebookslibrary.org/new-approaches-to-the-book-of-mormon-07/), p. 250)

Problems like this continue as the Book of Mormon story unfolds, and Kunich explains them in detail in his [article](http://signaturebookslibrary.org/new-approaches-to-the-book-of-mormon-07/). One way that people try to resolve the issue of population is by arguing that the newcomers mixed with a larger group of indigenous people but didn't mention them "out of an ethnocentric penchant" ([Kunich](http://signaturebookslibrary.org/new-approaches-to-the-book-of-mormon-07/) p. 260). This is unlikely for the following reasons:

- The Book of Mormon is quick to mention other historical events that were less notable than the act of assimilating a much larger native civilization upon arrival, let alone converting them to their religion.
- Lehi prophesied that their promised land would "be kept as yet from the knowledge of other nations; for behold, many nations would overrun the land, that there would be no place for an inheritance" ([2 Nephi 1:8-9](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/1.8-9#8)).
- Mixing with native people might explain the dark skin acquired by the Lamanites, but the Nephites apparently remained white (see [3 Nephi 2:15](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/2.15#15)), which means they could not have intermarried with indigenous people on the scale required for such population growth.

### archaeology

There's not much archaeology to back up anything that occurred in the Book of Mormon. Some people try to find parallels between the Book of Mormon civilizations and those discovered through archaeological evidence, but there's an important problem with parallels which Samuel Sandmel discusses with regard to the study of ancient Jewish and Christian texts:

> We might for our purposes define parallelomania as that extravagance among scholars which first overdoes the supposed similarity in passages and then proceeds to describe source and derivation as if implying literary connection flowing in an inevitable or predetermined direction. ([source](https://www.jstor.org/stable/3264821), p. 1)

You can see [here](http://www.solomonspalding.com/SRP/parallels.htm) an example of a defender of the Book of Mormon pointing out the extravagant "parallels" that a critic has found between the Book of Mormon and several 19th-century works in Joseph Smith's environment. It's easy to find parallels between books, civilizations, or anything else simply by basic commonality or random chance. Unfortunately, what scant parallels can be found between Book of Mormon civilization and pre-Columbian American civilizations can be chalked up to these natural explanations. And there's just no pre-Columbian American civilization that broadly matches the Book of Mormon descriptions, as one Redditor describes:

> The size of the civilizations described in the Book of Mormon could not have existed and left no trace behind. The western Roman empire is roughly contemporaneous with the Book of Mormon and has left coins, pottery, weapons, etc all over the place. Even in Britain where it last appeared, there is ample evidence left behind. Modern archelogy [sic] is perfectly capable of finding evidence of civilizations of the size described in the Book of Mormon from that long ago. Nothing has been found because there is nothing to find. Or worse, what has been found has nothing to do with the Book of Mormon. Something else happened instead. ([source](https://www.reddit.com/r/mormon/comments/m9wnbj/the_book_of_mormon_has_not_been_affirmatively/))

While there were relatively large civilizations like the [Olmecs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olmecs) (eastern Mexico 1500-400 BCE), [Maya](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maya_civilization) (southern Mexico and Guatemala 2000 BCE-800 CE), [Aztecs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aztecs) (southern Mexico 1300-1521 CE), or [Inca](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inca_Empire) (western South America 1300-1572 CE), none come close to matching the time period and events described in the Book of Mormon. This is much stronger evidence than the scant parallels that have been drawn between Book of Mormon civilizations and the wide variety of civilizations that existed in the Americas.

Sometimes it's argued that God wiped away the evidence of Book of Mormon peoples in order to test our faith. This quote describes how inconsistent that is with the way God works generally:

> As for locations being hidden to test faith, the old testament mentions hundreds of identified locations. Why did God not also test our faith by vanishing Egypt, Jericho, Jerusalem, Babylon, the whole of Greece and Rome, and any existence of their empires, or any records of their existence, except for one invisible manuscript that could only be seen by a group of eleven people and translated by just one of them four thousand years later? ... Did God hide all of this in the new world to test our faith, but in his infinite wisdom, leave the exact same type of evidence completely intact in the old world? It seems God left the old world almost unscathed, while wiping the Western hemisphere clean of any such corroborating details. Remember, "The Lord's house is a house of order". ([source](https://www.reddit.com/r/exmormon/comments/k6h0w4/the_absolute_minimum_it_would_take_for_the_book/))

It doesn't seem reasonable for God to hide so much evidence in the New World just to leave room for faith in Joseph Smith's story later, and not do the same thing with the Old World.

#### domesticated animals

The Book of Mormon lists the following domesticated animals: horses, cattle, oxen, sheep, swine, goats, asses, elephants, cureloms, cumoms (see [1 Nephi 18:25](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/18.25#25), [Alma 18:9](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/18.9#9), [Ether 9:18-19](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/ether/9.18-19#18), and this [BYU article](https://web.archive.org/web/20210703141240/https://scholarsarchive.byu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=4805&context=byusq), p. 136-138). Contrast that with the list of domesticated animals that we know existed in America through archaeological or eyewitness evidence: "The dog, 'llama', guinea pig, turkey, Muscovy duck, stingless bee, and the cochineal insect comprise the list of known Pre-Columbian, New World animal domesticates" ([source](https://web.archive.org/web/20161231205627/http://soar.wichita.edu/bitstream/handle/10057/1824/LAJ+2B21_p42-54.pdf;jsessionid=94CDE4B419B1DBA723961DC5DA5BED49?sequence=1)). The fact that the archaeological evidence supports an entirely disjoint set of domesticated animals from the ones mentioned in the Book of Mormon is a major issue. And it's not just that we haven't found any horse bones yet: consider for example what John Prince has to say about the effect of domestication on culture:

> Even if we grant that wild horses were around a given culture, the use of horses and chariots (or large wheeled vehicles of any kind) in the manner implied by Alma 18 and 20 is undocumented among any pre-Columbian Americans. The fallback apologetic model is that the chariot was more of a human-powered litter and the horses merely accompanied the kingly procession in order to provide food for the journey (there is some support for this in the text). Still, **we expect that such a program of domestication (for food or otherwise) would have left marks in a culture’s iconography and dramatically increased the odds that horse remains would be associated with archaeological digs** ... As it stands, there is no record of horses being domesticated for food by any pre-Columbian American culture of which I am aware. ([source](https://faenrandir.github.io/a_careful_examination/short-critique-horses-bom/); emphasis mine)

### plates of brass and plates of gold

> The fact is, that by the power of God I translated the book of Mormon from hierogliphics; the knowledge of which was lost to the world (Joseph Smith in a [letter](https://www.josephsmithpapers.org/paper-summary/letter-to-james-arlington-bennet-13-november-1843/1) to James Bennet, 1843)

[1 Nephi 5:10-13](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/5.10-13#10) notes that the plates of brass contained the five books of Moses as well as all the prophets down the Jeremiah, and [Mosiah 1:3-4](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/1.3-4#3) says that the plates of brass were written in Egyptian. David Bokovoy discusses how unlikely this is:

> And we should note that even that material [the Dead Sea scrolls] is not a Bible. The concept of a book, you know, bringing all this material together and putting it in a book, that is a medieval notion or creation, of bringing things together like that. ... It is even more difficult for the Book of Mormon unfortunately---or challenging for traditional understandings or perceptions---because not only with the Pentateuch those five books have to exist as a bound book, but they'd have to be bound with the other material including Isaiah ... Going back to then the BoM, not only did that material not exist, but it would have had to have been translated (according to the BoM) into Egyptian. ... So not only would that material (for the Book of Mormon's traditional assumption) have to exist, but a *translation* of it would have to exist---into Egyptian! And as a historian I just can't find any way that that would mesh with the data. ... We will see translations of that sacred material put together but that'll be part of the Septuagint which is a Greek translation done in Alexandria, Egypt, you know, a couple of centuries before Jesus was born. (from an [interview](https://youtu.be/A4gSrxVa5To) with Mormon Stories, starting at [46:52](https://youtu.be/A4gSrxVa5To?t=2812))

The brass plates being in Egyptian also makes it more suspicious that the Book of Mormon Bible quotes are so similar to the KJV. The KJV Old Testament is mainly translated from the Hebrew Masoretic text and never passed through Egyptian, so a translation from Egyptian should not match the KJV so well.

In addition, archaeologists have not found examples of writing on metal plates anywhere in the Americas or in the Middle East ([source](https://www.fairlatterdaysaints.org/evidences/Examples_of_ancient_writing_on_metal_plates)). The [Pyrgi plates]([Pyrgi tablets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyrgi_Tablets)) are dated to 500 BC and were found in Italy (relatively near Israel), but they are nothing near the scale of the Book of Mormon. For the Book of Mormon to have been written with characters the size of those on the Pyrgi plates, the golden plates would have to have been far larger than "six inches wide and eight inches long and not quite so thick as common tin", with the whole set "something near six inches in thickness" ([source](http://www.centerplace.org/history/ts/v3n09.htm), p. 706).

On the other hand if Joseph wrote the Book of Mormon the choice of Egyptian for both the brass and gold plates makes more sense. Early 19th-century America was fascinated with ancient Egypt. Napoleon had recently taken control of Egypt and all sorts of artifacts were being brought back to the West, including the mummies and papyri that later came into the possession of Joseph Smith ([source](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/manual/gospel-topics/translation-and-historicity-of-the-book-of-abraham); look under "Origin of the Book of Abraham"). At this time many believed that hieroglyphs were pictographic, not phonetic ([source](https://archive.org/details/egyptancientmode00russ/page/140/mode/2up), p. 140; see also Noah Webster's [definition](http://webstersdictionary1828.com/Dictionary/Hieroglyph) of *hieroglyph* from 1828). It was a common belief that Egyptian hieroglyphs could represent the equivalent of whole sentences or paragraphs in English (TODO source). An extremely compressed, undeciphered language is a good choice if Joseph's going to pretend to translate a 268,163-word book from plates that are the size mentioned above.

### 19th-century American ideas about indigenous Americans

As Europeans arrived in the New World, they wanted to be able to explain the existence of the indigenous population they encountered. For Americans, a prominent source of intrigue was the mounds that could be found all over the Ohio river valley (see known mound locations [here](https://www.google.com/maps/d/viewer?msa=0&mid=1R2PaO3dIlkDTiJnG2mvYUjzEtsE)). Various theories abounded, but the major theme was that the Native Americans currently living there were not culturally capable of accomplishing such massive constructions. The overriding belief was that the "savage" Native Americans must have come and destroyed whatever civilization had built these mounds. It's now understood that the mounds were built by the same culture that lived there at the time of European arrival in Ohio in the 17th century. You can read more about the moundbuilder myth in this [Ohio history article](https://web.archive.org/web/20201112000735/https://www.ohiohistory.org/learn/collections/archaeology/archaeology-blog/2011/june-2011/the-moundbuilder-myth).

This idea about a separate civilization building the mounds and then being destroyed was reflected in American popular culture, as seen in the poem "The Prairies" by William Bryant (full text [here](https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/55341/the-prairies)):

> “Let the mighty mounds
>
> That overlook the rivers, or that rise
>
> In the dim forest crowded with old oaks,
>
> Answer. A race, that long has passed away,
>
> Built them;—a disciplined and populous race…

> In a forgotten language, and old tunes,
>
> From instruments of unremembered form,
>
> Gave the soft winds a voice. The red man came—
>
> The roaming hunter tribes, warlike and fierce,
>
> And the mound-builders vanished from the earth….

> All is gone;
>
> All—save the piles of earth that hold their bones,
>
> The platforms where they worshipped unknown gods,
>
> The barriers which they builded from the soil
>
> To keep the foe at bay—till o’er the walls
>
> The wild beleaguerers broke, and, one by one,
>
> The strongholds of the plain were forced, and heaped
>
> With corpses. ...

In 1829 President Andrew Jackson gave a speech in support of the Indian Removal Act, in which he mentions that "in the monuments and fortresses of an unknown people, spread over the extensive regions of the West, we behold the memorials of a once powerful race, which was exterminated or has disappeared to make room for the existing savage tribes" ([source](https://web.archive.org/web/20210414150407/https://www.mtholyoke.edu/acad/intrel/andrew.htm)).

More evidence of the influence Joseph's environment might have had on the Book of Mormon narrative is the book *View of the Hebrews*, written by Ethan Smith (not related to Joseph). Ethan Smith was the pastor of a church in Poultney, Vermont, that Oliver Cowdery attended. He published the book twice, once in 1823 and again in 1825. It's unclear whether Oliver Cowdery and Ethan Smith ever met or knew each other personally ([source](https://web.archive.org/web/20210323194433/https://byustudies.byu.edu/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/39.1MorrisOliver-8f403b91-8468-424d-8789-a99672f16e4b.pdf)), but *View of the Hebrews* strongly demonstrates that many Book of Mormon ideas about indigenous American civilizations were ideas available to Joseph at the time he produced the Book of Mormon:

| **idea** | **in the Book of Mormon** | **in *View of the Hebrews*** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| destruction of Jerusalem | [2 Nephi 1:4](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/1.4#4) | [chapter 1](https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/View_of_the_Hebrews/Chapter_1) |

| hieroglyphs in America based on Egyptian hieroglyphs | [1 Nephi 1:2](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/1.2#2); in 1843 Joseph claimed to have translated the BoM from hieroglyphics ([source](https://www.josephsmithpapers.org/paper-summary/letter-to-james-arlington-bennet-13-november-1843/1)) | [p. 140](https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/View_of_the_Hebrews/Chapter_3_(pages_125-144)) |
| Israelites in America separate; one group becomes "savage" and lives off wild game while the other remains civilized and builds forts and mounds in times of war | [2 Nephi 5:1-7](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/5.1-7#1), [Enos 1:20](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/enos/1.20#20), [2 Nephi 5:22-24](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/5.22-24#22), [Alma 22:28](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/22.28#28), [Alma 49:2-4](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/49.2-4#2) | [p. 130-131](https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/View_of_the_Hebrews/Chapter_3_(pages_125-144)) |
| indigenous Americans will be brought the gospel by a Gentile nation, and then become part of the literal restoration of the tribes of Israel | [3 Nephi 16](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/16) | [p. 78](https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/View_of_the_Hebrews/Chapter_3_(pages_65-84)), [193](https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/View_of_the_Hebrews/Chapter_4) |

Obviously there are differences between the two works:

- The Book of Mormon is talking about the Babylonian destruction of Jerusalem in 600 BCE, while it's the 70 CE Roman destruction of Jerusalem that appears in *View of the Hebrews*.
- In the Book of Mormon Lehi is of the tribe of Manasseh (see [Alma 10:3](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/10.3#3)), while in *View of the Hebrews* those who come to the New World are of the 10 lost tribes in general.
- The Book of Mormon was translated from reformed Egyptian on a set of golden plates, while *View of the Hebrews* is talking about a set of buried parchments written in Hebrew.
- The Book of Mormon never mentions the word "hieroglyph".

But the contents of *View of the Hebrews* make it clear that many ideas present in the Book of Mormon reflect the views Americans had of indigenous people at the time.

It's important to note that in multiple locations in the Doctrine and Covenants we see God referring to the native Americans west of the United States as Lamanites (see [D&C 28:8](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/28.8#8), [54:8](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/54.8#8), ; see also the heading "The Book of Mormon and the Lamanites" [here](https://www.ldsdiscussions.com/dna)), so it's clear that the Book of Mormon is talking about these people and not others.

## similarity of the Book of Mormon's theology to its 19th century theological context

> "And then there is the fact that there is phrasing everywhere---long phrases that if you google them you will find them in 19th century writings. The theology of the Book of Mormon is very much 19th century theology, and it reads like a 19th century understanding of the Hebrew Bible as an Old Testament. That is, it has Christ in it the way Protestants saw Christ everywhere in the Old Testament. That’s why we now call it “Hebrew Bible” because the Jews never saw it quite that way. So, these are all problems we have to deal with." -- Richard Bushman, Church historian ([source](http://www.mormondiscussionpodcast.org/2017/05/premium-book-mormon-historicity/))

The Book of Mormon contains 19th-century Christian theology that would not have existed at the time Lehi left Jerusalem:

- The Book of Mormon taught a rather trinitarian view of God, in contrast with Joseph's later revelations on the Godhead. You can see this in [Mosiah 15:1-5](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/15.1-5#1), but also in several locations of the 1830 edition of the Book of Mormon that were changed later. In bold is the text added in the 1837 edition:
  - 1 Nephi 11:18: Behold, the virgin whom thou seest is the mother **of the son** of God ([modern](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/11.18#18), [1830 edition](https://www.josephsmithpapers.org/paper-summary/book-of-mormon-1830/31))
  - 1 Nephi 11:21: Behold, the Lamb of God, yea, even **the Son of** the Eternal Father! ([modern](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/11.21#21), [1830 edition](https://www.josephsmithpapers.org/paper-summary/book-of-mormon-1830/31))
  - 1 Nephi 11:32: yea, **the Son of** the everlasting God was judged of the world ([modern](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/11.32#32), [1830 edition](https://www.josephsmithpapers.org/paper-summary/book-of-mormon-1830/32))
  - 1 Nephi 13:40: the Lamb of God is **the Son of** the Eternal Father, and the Savior of the world ([modern](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/13.40#40), [1830 edition](https://www.josephsmithpapers.org/paper-summary/book-of-mormon-1830/38))
- The Book of Mormon mentions "slippery treasures" ([Helaman 12:18-19](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/hel/12.18-19#18), [13:35](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/hel/13.35#35); [Mormon 1:18-19](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/morm/1.18-19#18)), which was a common theme from 19th-century treasure digging. You can see this concept in accounts of Joseph's treasure digs, like [this one](https://www.josephsmithpapers.org/paper-summary/appendix-docket-entry-20-march-1826-people-v-js/1#ft-source-note).
- In Batavia, New York, a prominent anti-Mason named William Morgan disappeared in 1826 under strange circumstances that left the public believing that he had been killed by Masons. This sparked a huge anti-Mason fervor, which saw the creation of the Anti-Masonic Party, the founding of several anti-Masonic newspapers, and substantial controversy over the election of Andrew Jackson, a Mason ([source](https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=uva.x001085979&view=1up), [p. 162-164](https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=uva.x001085979&view=1up&seq=170), [204-205](https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=uva.x001085979&view=1up&seq=212)). It's clear that early believers in the Book of Mormon saw it as "anti-Masonick" ([source](https://www.jstor.org/stable/43200831?read-now=1)), and you can see why in places like [Helaman 6:21-23](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/hel/6.21-23#21). In fact, you can read much of the book of Helaman as a discourse on the moral and political deterioration that people believed would occur if the Masons controlled American public society.

### to do

- charismatic revivals
- concepts of the Atonement: "Atonement theology took many decades to develop in the first century of the Christian movement, and continued to develop beyond that time. But it appears more or less fully developed among the Nephites many centuries before even the birth of Jesus. Penal Substitution theory is quite late, modeled on feudalistic crime and punishment, but it's in the BOM. The earliest form of atonement theology is the ransom theory of atonement (first century CE), but it's not in the BOM." ([source](https://www.reddit.com/r/mormon/comments/ayfqas/there_is_no_case_to_be_made_for_a_historical_book/))
- "A Christology among the Nephites that seems to be influenced by the Gospel of John - that is to say, a Jesus who was Son of God from before his birth, as opposed to a Jesus who was adopted as God's son at his birth or baptism as an adult, as is taught in the earlier gospels." ([source](https://www.reddit.com/r/mormon/comments/ayfqas/there_is_no_case_to_be_made_for_a_historical_book/))

- show how Joseph's magical world view influenced the coming forth and contents of the Book of Mormon ([source](https://www.reddit.com/r/mormon/comments/mppgtc/a_brief_summary_of_the_magical_origins_of_the/))
- look at this [article](https://www.reddit.com/r/exmormon/comments/n8dtcm/this_is_probably_the_best_article_ive_seen_on_the/) about Captain Kidd and how the story may have influenced Joseph Smith

- look at Grant Palmer's thoughts on the preaching
- read about [anachronistic Christian doctrine](https://www.churchistrue.com/blog/anachronistic-christian-doctrine-in-book-of-mormon/) in the Book of Mormon
- Discuss Bokovoy's thoughts on the Christology in the Book of Mormon
- 1-2 Nephi seems very aware of the contents of Mosiah-Moroni, but Mosiah-Moroni seems unaware of the contents of 1-2 Nephi (Jesus being named Jesus by an angel in Mosiah when Nephi already knew, for example).

## Book of Mormon translation process

[This interesting document](https://www.docdroid.net/sUW5NhW/book-of-mormon-details-pdf) compiles a huge list of long-range dependencies present in the Book of Mormon that Joseph would have to have kept track of in order to write the Book of Mormon himself. Critics either have to assume that he could remember all such details without notes, or that the several witnesses to the translation process (including Michael Morse, who never joined the church) were all deceived or lying when they said that he had no notes with him as he read from a seer stone inside a hat. One unlikely possibility is that he kept a pre-written manuscript inside his hat, but that seems farfetched. A more likely possibility is that most or all of the translation witnesses were in collusion with the exception of Michael Morse, who was given a false presentation of the translation process, but this again feels like shaky ground to stand on.

This is the one thing about the church that is hard to explain from a critical standpoint.

### to do

- read this document more carefully
- study historical sources relating to the translation process of the Book of Mormon
- [how might Joseph have written it](https://www.mormonstories.org/podcast/visions-in-a-seer-stone-joseph-smith-and-the-making-of-the-book-of-mormon-william-l-davis/)
- read the Urantia book
- talk about how stylometry demonstrates that Joseph had a reasonable level of influence on the English text of the Book of Mormon (see [this](http://www.withoutend.org/stylistic-drift-book-mormon-dictation/))
- read *On Bullshit*
- mention how the revelations in the BoM are very specific (Jesus, America, Joseph son of Joseph, etc.), but then not so specific afterward ([ldsdiscussions](https://www.ldsdiscussions.com/influences))
  - also the 116 pages and how sketchy that is
- talk about how [D&C 9](https://www.reddit.com/r/mormon/comments/ovw0gr/was_translation_by_inspiration_hidden_right_under/) supports a loose translation
- talk about how Joseph claims a literal translation during the process, and also later in Times and Seasons
- Dan Vogel thinks that Joseph taught everyone how he received revelation, which was just thinking and a burning in the bosom. Vogel thinks that's how Joseph received the Book of Mormon, as evidenced by D&C 8 with Oliver.
- The Book of Mormon matches *better* with Joseph's 19th century American context than the archaeology we have of the New World. That's what convinces me it's a modern creation. Mention Nahom and chiasmus and point to this [interview with Dan Vogel](https://youtu.be/eJV_B2JZZ-4) where he explains why Nahom and chiasmus don't show much.

## other translation efforts of Joseph Smith

We don't have all of the papyri that Joseph had when he translated the Book of Abraham, but what we do have left over are just standard Egyptian funerary texts. The interpretations Joseph provided for the facsimiles are definitely wrong though, and those facsimiles are all present on the funerary texts that we still have. Even apologists are often left arguing that Joseph was simply inspired by the presence of the papyri to create a "translation" that he received directly from God. But that translation looks a lot like what you'd expect to appear, given popular opinion of the day about the pseudepigraphal Book of Enoch and about black people being the cursed descendants of Cain. The church now disavows that racist idea, but it's present in the Book of Abraham.

### to do

- read Joseph Smith: Rough Stone Rolling
- [ ] get sources for this
- [ ] read [this](http://jur.byu.edu/?p=21296)
- think about these notes from a Mormon Stories interview with Jim Bennett:
  - The changing in Joseph's theology from trinitarian to split is reflected in the Lectures on Faith, the Book of Mormon, and the First Vision accounts. That's a simple, strong case.
  - With Jim Bennett, you have to believe that Joseph was making up all these authenticity stories (Abraham, Kinderhook plates, etc.) and believing them, but that they were incorrect stories.
  - Joseph likely wasn't an intentional fraud, but we know for a fact that he said some things that were false about what he was doing. Joseph was sincere (quote his journal entry), but he believed in himself too much (Book of Abraham, Kinderhook Plates).

## what did Joseph and others say about the Book of Mormon and other revelatory works?

### to do

- decide whether it's ok that the Book of Mormon is not an ancient record but an inspired creation
  - study what Joseph Smith and the witnesses to the translation process said about the Book of Mormon
  - study what modern prophets say about the truthfulness of the Book of Mormon
- look at the [characters documents](https://www.josephsmithpapers.org/paper-summary/appendix-2-copies-of-book-of-mormon-characters-introduction/1)
- The Book of Mormon can't be true and also not historical. Let's see what Joseph was saying about it. Would God trick him?
- Here are some [sources](https://www.reddit.com/r/mormon/comments/ok6ljb/processing_the_real_book_of_mormon_my_experience/) for what Joseph and others said.
- The Book of Mormon was written *to* the Lamanites, but now we don't know where they are (DNA evidence).

## the First Vision

The First Vision is confusing because:

- There are four different accounts that contradict one another, and the story tends to be embellished over time.
- Earlier accounts do not reference the visit of both God the Father and Jesus Christ as two individuals, which lines up with the trinitarian view that Joseph Smith had at the beginning of his prophetic career. It also lines up with the trinitarian language present in the earliest version of the Book of Mormon.

## to do

- [ ] get sources for this
- [ ] turn this into a section about how Joseph often used revelations and visions when they were useful

## polygamy

Joseph married 32-38 women, some of whom were only 14 years old. Others were already married (which was forbidden by D&C 132); there are several cases where he sent men off on missions and then married their wives while they were gone. He kept these marriages mostly hidden from Emma, disobeying another requirement from D&C 132. Would he really be so hesitant to do polygamy for so long (thus keeping things secret) but at the same time go overkill and marry women who are already married, a mistake according to D&C 132?

## the temple

The ordinances of the temple were based on rituals from the Masons, and they have been modified a lot since their revelation. The symbols used in the temple used to be explained as symbolic of the promise that you would first kill yourself rather than reveal the symbols in the temple. The symbols have changed a bit over time to reduce that symbolism.

You aren't even told beforehand what you're promising, and when you're there the only way out is by standing up in front of everyone, near the beginning when they explain some of what you'll promise. No one is going to do that.

## faith and confirmations from the Spirit

> "You will not get to know it [whether the Book of Mormon is true] by trying to prove it archaeologically, or by DNA, or by anything else... Religious truth is always confirmed by what you feel. And that’s the way Heavenly Father answers prayers.” (M. Russell Ballard, Mormon Newsroom, Oct 4 2007 ([YouTube](https://youtu.be/3AQTr9oB8lw)))

The church teaches that the way to know the truth is by reading the Book of Mormon and praying to know if it's true. The promise is that if we sincerely want to know then God will manifest the truth of it through the Holy Ghost (see [Moroni 10:3-5](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/moro/10.3-5#3)). The Holy Ghost can feel different for each person (see this [New Era article](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/new-era/2014/06/what-if-i-dont-feel-a-burning-in-the-bosom?lang=eng)), but it generally feels like an inspiring, uplifting, motivating feeling.

My problem is that there are lots of churches, religions, and cults that tell you to discover truth this way. Here's some evidence:

- This [video](https://youtu.be/ycUvC9s4VYA) (14:03) shows some examples of people who feel convinced of the truth of Islam, the RLDS and FLDS churches, and even some strange suicide cults.
- This [video](https://youtu.be/UJMSU8Qj6Go) (13:02) has some more examples of the testimonies of people who've converted to many religions, including mainstream Mormonism. This video has some scenes taken from the previous one.
- This [Preach podcast interview with Satin Tashnizi](https://emeraldproject.org/project/preach-podcast-kuer/) (25:26) investigates her process of converting to Islam. The entire Preach series is a really great look at how religion works for people for reasons that don't necessarily imply truthfulness.
- There are several YouTubers who practice something called [Street Epistemology](https://streetepistemology.com/). "The general goal of Street Epistemology is to help people to reflect on the reasons and methods that they use to conclude that their deeply-held beliefs are true" ([source](https://streetepistemology.com/faq)). These YouTubers interview people with a wide variety of beliefs, asking questions that help the interviewee (and us) understand their reasons for believing what they do. The following videos are pretty demonstrative:
  - [Emily's faith in the Christian God](https://youtu.be/1RbpbWXg_Pw) (24:44)
  - [Madison's belief in the Christian God](https://youtu.be/d5tjfvPysSI) (46:30)
  - [Tia's belief in the Christian God](https://youtu.be/A-M1EyhcRS8) (11:05)
  - [Eric's belief in astrology](https://youtu.be/hl2sOsEL9v4) (minimal language warning) (36:46)
  - [Elder Macedone's belief in the Book of Mormon](https://youtu.be/DhKGiw0ZVBM) (31:43)
  - [Jenny and Anthony's belief in the Book of Mormon](https://youtu.be/bh9IYjRYBx4) (1:01:30)

Many people of many different religions come to their faith by this process of studying and thinking about what is being taught, and then having feelings or experiences they attribute to God that tell them that what they're learning is true. While there are certainly truths and good things in most religions, if the same mechanism is in place for determining the goodness of *any* religion, how does my spiritual witness of the truth of this church confirm to me that this is the *most correct* religion of all?

A friend of mine once answered this question by saying that while you can get good feelings due to the truth found in other religions, this is the only religion that invites you to seek out that confirmation by *directly asking God*. This is something I used to really focus on when I was teaching people about the church on my mission. This idea is plausible as long as the answer received is distinct from that of other religions, but the videos I linked above make it pretty clear that's not the case.

It's easy to see why this isn't a good test for truth if we compare it to healing from a sickness. Let's say you and I have the same disease, and we both take something different for it and immediately start to feel better. There are four possibilities:

1. Both our remedies cured us from the illness. (both religions are equally and completely true)
1. Neither of our remedies actually cured us and we just got better naturally. (neither religion is true despite our spiritual witnesses)
1. Yours was a cure but mine was not. (your religion is true but mine is not)
1. Mine was a cure but yours was not. (my religion is true but yours is not)

Case 1 is impossible (in the case of religion), so at least one of us is deceived in thinking their remedy was a cure. In this hypothetical, it's easy to see that we would need a different test in order to determine which remedies were cures. If I pray and ask God and then feel that Mormonism is right, how is that different from doing whatever Islam requires of me in order to receive a confirmation, and then feeling that Islam is right in the same way? A religion may even *work* for someone---bring them peace, inspire them, teach them true things---while not being true. Check out this [video](https://youtu.be/6nXDzbxhqfE) (14:59) that makes a strong case for this.

In [*Faith is Not Blind*]({{< relref "/book/faith-is-not-blind" >}}) Elder and Sister Hafen talk about "a witness more powerful than sight". To them, that witness is the closeness you feel to the Savior when you sacrifice to serve Him. You can see this happen to missionaries both ancient and modern, and I think this happens for religious people regardless of the particular religion.

It was a big realization for me that signs had *not* followed me despite my belief in Jesus Christ, contrary to what [Ether 4:18](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/ether/4.18#18) promises. And that verse isn't a fluke; Joseph Smith makes the same promise of miracles and signs in Lectures on Faith ([source](https://lecturesonfaith.com/7/#20)), and [Moroni 10:23-25](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/moro/10.23-25#23) says if we don't see the power of God in our lives then it's because of unbelief and none of us does any good works. As a believer there are two ways to deal with not seeing miracles in your life: you can think your faith is inadequate and blame yourself, or you can see miracles and signs in ordinary events in your life. The human brain is very good at self-doubt and also very good at recognizing meaning in randomness ([source](https://archive.is/20130121151738/http://www.dbskeptic.com/2007/11/04/apophenia-definition-and-analysis/)), so this usually works well enough to get you to ignore the problem.

None of this disproves Mormonism, but it does mean that the method it asks you to use to determine its truthfulness is built on a sandy foundation (see [Matthew 7:26](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/matt/7.26#26)).

### to do

  - find out why people of indigenous faith believe what they do
  - find out why Buddhists/Hindus/Sikhs/Taoists believe what they do
  - read studies about spiritual experience
- To show you why this is true, I'm going to demonstrate to you that the Book of Mormon is probably not an ancient book, but was in fact written in the 19th century. This will hopefully show you how a book can teach good things without being factual.

## the modern church

In the church we talk about how great it is to have both a modern prophet and personal revelation. But there's a problem as soon as we acknowledge the fallibility of both the prophet and our internal sense for truth. As soon as those two sources of truth conflict, we no longer have a clear method of determining truth, and this is important because of real issues like caring for LGBTQ people or protesting systemic racism. A common response to this conflict is to doubt your personal revelation and wonder if sin or imperfect desires leave you mistaken in your perception of the Spirit's promptings. This leaves no room for you to construct a test to determine whether the Spirit actually makes sense at all as an external influence.

The faith-reinforcing teachings and culture of the church are common to other faiths and especially high-demand religions. The documentary "Going Clear: Scientology and the Prison of Belief" ([YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLLKsMxPqn0)) demonstrates that other high-demand religions use similar tactics to get people to keep *themselves* within the faith.

- We are asked to bear our testimonies, which is a common cult tactic used to reinforce belief ([relevant Reddit comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/exmormon/comments/k67xs1/what_was_the_first_thing_that_started_your_search/gejdpre/)). We are trained (and train our kids) to say "I know" when in fact it is just a belief. President Boyd Packer taught that "a testimony is to be found in the bearing of it". (See [this blog post](https://www.patheos.com/blogs/faithpromotingrumor/2010/12/revisiting-a-testimony-is-to-be-found-in-the-bearing-of-it/) for a valuable discussion of the context of this quote.)
- The way Miscavage (second leader of Scientology) talks about preaching Scientology is designed to threaten you into guilt over it. "When your head hits the pillow, can you rest easy knowing you've done enough?"
- Another tool shared between Scientology and Mormonism is demonstrated in this quote from an ex-Scientologist: "Scientology was really good at getting you to feel like a scoundrel." In both Mormonism and Scientology, rules and confession to breaking those rules are used to make the believer feel that any unhappiness they feel in the religion is their own fault due to disobedience, rather than an external issue. This is much more strongly used in Scientology but is still present in Mormonism.
- In a 2018 conference talk entitled "Truth and the Plan" ([link](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/general-conference/2018/10/truth-and-the-plan)), President Oaks talked about discovering religious truth. Here's one quote that really bothered me: "We should not consider secular prominence or authority as qualified sources of truth." This is a classic conspiracy tactic designed to get you to reject other sources of knowledge. I used to be comfortable with using the epistemology of science for scientific things and the epistemology of faith for religious things, but one thing us religious people have often ignored is that true things can withstand scrutiny from all valid truth-seeking approaches. We may not be able to scientifically determine if God exists, but we can perform linguistic studies of the Book of Mormon text to discover if it relies on 19th century books available to Joseph Smith. "What we know will always trump what we do not know" is problematic when it causes us to reject information that ought to modify our working hypothesis.

The church spends billions of dollars on building temples, while spending far less on humanitarian efforts. (See [this Reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/exmormon/comments/7lccwv/they_rob_the_poor_because_of_their_fine/) about how we might not need to spend so much on temples.)

- These prophets don't look like prophets. We can look at the misguided morals of past prophets and excuse them by noting that they were of a different time, but that's moral relativism (which the church abhors). The church isn't ahead on social issues, but it isn't ahead on morality or or the Atonement either! Prophets really only provide "prophetic morality". They don't predict future events. They are supposed to just give us the inside scope on God's thoughts about moral action. When these prophets don't even give moral guidance that stands the test of time, but actually fight against moral progress, you know they are not Godly, just powerful and holding on to that power.

    > ... If you're to have a crystalline structure, you have to have regulating authority so everyone has the same understanding. And this is usually abetted through, you know, various institutional forms in the Church, but also because you have a monopoly on living prophets, right? You have 15 people that individually or collectively, can go and speak authoritatively. At least that's the common understanding. And they have what's close to a monopoly on the production of religious truth. It's more complicated than that in actual life, because oftentimes they are lagging indicators of where the center of Mormon religious intellectual life is from time to time. But that's simply where it looks to me from the outside.
    >
    > ... it has to do with governance and an aspect of governance is legitimacy. And this is a claim to legitimacy because you have a transference. And if one were to imagine an alternate scenario in which Joseph Smith was possessed by Adam, Or Paul or Peter or John or whoever wills right. Well, that would grant Joseph Smith or whoever's in the body of Joseph Smith at that moment, like almost unrivaled authority until the moment of possession passes. And then Joseph Smith would lose access to it. So, you really do need to have transfer of “keys.” You need to have some kind of shift, some kind of continuation or passing on of legitimacy and power in ways that spirit possession could not give in a stable manner. And if you're thinking about institution building, and we know that Joseph Smith was fascinated with institution building, you can see that that's absolutely something that you need. Because when you take a look at possession religions or possession phenomena that's associated with religion, to go back to it, one of the things we noted is usually these are on the fringes of religion, and one reason, arguably one can say is because you can't build institutions in possession. You may have some powerful moments and peak affective phenomena, but once the spirit leaves, it's gone. And if you want to do something, you have to recreate the phenomena again and again and again, rather than being able to go and build on it. Like one can when you have a transfer of keys, when you have the, how shall I say, when you have the priesthood power returning after the Great Apostasy.

## what this all says about God

> I'm not the first person to notice that it's a very strange sort of loving god who would make salvation depend on believing in him on bad evidence. (Sam Harris, [YouTube](https://youtu.be/AcO4TnrskE0))

### to do

- talk about how the concept of sin is psychologically harmful, like in [this meme](https://www.reddit.com/r/exmormon/comments/m9op82/what_a_loving_god/)
- include this [comic](https://www.reddit.com/r/exmormon/comments/m79dj8/the_great_apostasy_god_forgot_about_earth_for/) that put the idea of a Great Apostasy and the weird stuff of the Restoration in a humorous light
- talk about how this religion doesn't really innovate on the subject of morality much. Mention how the world already knows a lot about safety from dangerous things (like from alcohol for example).
- You can't argue that religion isn't designed to answer questions about ethics because then that means God isn't interested in the most ethical people but in the most obedient, faith-filled people.

- The way Mormons talk about Satan's fight against the church is similar to conspiracy theories. Mormonism has certainly had its share of miracles, but it's also had its fair share of demonic possessions and stuff. Why does the rate of *both* increase? Is this observable in other religions?

- work out the thesis statement a bit better
- What I'm really emphasizing are sources that can be backed up from right at home using your computer.
- MAKE TOTALLY SURE THAT THIS DOCUMENT IS *NOT* COMPREHENSIVE. JUST MAKE THE STRONGEST, MOST CONCISE POINTS POSSIBLE AND POINT PEOPLE ELSEWHERE FOR MORE RESOURCES.
- Put spiritual witnesses next to the BITE model discussion so that together they describe all of the powerful emotions attached to membership in the church. The song "Where We'll Never Grow Old" by The Lower Lights still gets me now, because the hope for that sort of place is so strong.
- The church hijacks healthy practices and claims them as their own. Take for example the repentance process. In reality, anyone can recognize a mistake, plead forgiveness of those wronged, and choose to do better. It doesn't require someone to pay for the sin. We don't even need Jesus in order to forgive someone who we feel has wronged us, which is clear when you watch Mormon Stories 1457, ending at 46:54. People experience feelings of unconditional forgiveness and redemption without the need to believe someone else paid for the sin. But the church teaches people that those feelings come from the Savior, and so it causes people to feel reliant on the church/gospel to have access to those feelings. The same thing comes up about spiritual promptings, around 1:04:00.
- Talk about how Joseph Smith said the ordinances would never be changed. Who do we trust?
- Talk about how hypnosis and missionary teaching both use methods of suggested emotion to convince people. See [this conversation with Nolan](https://matrix.to/#/!iYdNOFdgBixuOiakEp:kylrth.com/$V-evPywU74QX3LUrrxFQqCiv9gL0Xk_Vowt3nMEp7kA?via=kylrth.com)

- notes from Stephen Hassan's Mormon Stories interview:
  - Lots of religions/cults teach that contrary ideas come from evil spirits or Satan. This is a thought-stopping technique.
  - Loaded language is vocabulary that the cult uses as thought-stopping cliche (examples plz)
  - Boredom is an effective way to induce hypnotic states
  - Burning of the bosom could be induced by hallucinating the concept that was suggested to you
  - Phobia indoctrination: if they leave, terrible things will happen
  - When you have the phobia, you can only generate negative visualizations of life if you left
- [quotes from general authorities](https://redlib.kylrth.com/r/exmormon/comments/13wy1m6/what_made_you_realize_the_lds_church_is_a_cult/jme89ou/?context=3) checking the boxes of the BITE model

- How does flat earth theory get debunked? [On technicalities.](https://youtu.be/sq0GmI1JFkw) Analyze the arguments of flat earthers and show how they're similar to Rod Meldrum or others.

- [this post](https://redlib.kylrth.com/r/exmormon/comments/xvw7d0/so_whos_right_hahahahahayou_cant_make_this_kind/) can be used to make a really simple point about the difficulty of listening to a prophet's teachings. It's easy because it's a small issue, which can then be compared with big issues (e.g. the temple/priesthood ban for black people)

- This quote from Holland in 2022:

    > No-one should tolerate any ludicrous, even laughable, middle-ground about "what a wonderful contour of the young boy's imagination, or his remarkable facility for turning a literary phrase". That is NOT an acceptable position to take morally, literarily, historically, or theologically.

    It's from [this video](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/broadcasts/watch/devotional-for-single-adults/2022/11?lang=eng). 1:23:35 for the whole segment, 1:27:09 for the quote.
- This [funny thing about earwax](https://redlib.kylrth.com/r/exmormon/comments/12rsced/earwax_helped_break_my_shelf/) (along with all the other genetic stuff) pigeonholes apologists into saying that Lehite DNA disappeared in America and the Polynesians.
