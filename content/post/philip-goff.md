Here are some snippets from a Lex Fridman [interview](https://web.archive.org/web/20221222002116/https://lexfridman.com/philip-goff/) with Philip Goff, a panpsychist.

> The Enlightenment ideal is to follow the evidence and the arguments where they lead, but it's very hard for human beings to do that. I think we get stuck in some conception of how we think science ought to look. People talk about religion as a crutch, but I think a certain kind of scientism, a certain conception of how science is supposed to be, gets into people's identity and their sense of themselves and their security.

After listening to the episode, I don't think I assign a very high probability to panpsychism. But it did cause me to examine my materialist assumptions, which I had never done before.
