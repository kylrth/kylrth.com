## faith and confirmations from the Spirit

The church teaches that the way to know the truth is by reading the Book of Mormon and praying to know if it's true. The promise is that if we sincerely want to know then God will manifest the truth of it through the Holy Ghost. The Holy Ghost can feel different for each person, but it generally feels like an inspiring, uplifting, motivating feeling.

My problem is that there are lots of churches, religions, and cults that tell you to discover truth this way. [This video](https://youtu.be/ycUvC9s4VYA) shows some examples of people who feel convinced of the truth of Islam, the RLDS and FLDS churches, and even some strange suicide cults. They all seemed to come to their faith by this process of studying and thinking about what was being taught, and then having feelings they attributed to God that told them what they were learning was true. While there are certainly truths and good things in most religions, if the same mechanism is in place for determining the goodness of *any* religion, how does my spiritual witness of the truth of this church confirm to me that this is the *most correct* religion of all? It seems like the likely explanation is that the brain itself is capable of producing feelings of peace as a result of a real desire to know the truth.

Here's an [article](https://zelphontheshelf.com/is-god-real-a-response-to-mormon-org/) from ZOTS that does a good job explaining this problem with confirming the truth of the existence of God.

In the church we talk about how great it is to have both a modern prophet and personal revelation. But there's a problem as soon as we acknowledge the fallibility of both the prophet and our internal sense for truth. As soon as those conflict we don't have a clear method of determining truth, and this is important because of issues like caring for LGBTQ people or protesting systemic racism.

## Deutero-Isaiah (and other inclusions of KJV text)

Biblical scholars are all mostly in consensus that chapters 40-66 of Isaiah were written by another author or authors after the exile into Babylon, which occurred in 586 BCE. They believe this because of abrupt changes in historical situation, use of the name "Isaiah", style, and theology ([source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Book_of_Isaiah#Authorship)). For example, the name "Cyrus" (the king who would liberate the Jews) is explicitly used in Isaiah 45, so the author of Isaiah 45 was aware of this historical event ([source](https://www.ldsdiscussions.com/deuteroisaiah)). Unfortunately, these chapters appear in the Book of Mormon nearly exactly as they appear in the King James version of the Bible. For example, 1 Nephi 20 is taken from Isaiah 48, which calls the Israelites to leave Babylon. In Isaiah this is a literal call as well as a spiritual call, because the chapter was written during Babylonian exile, a period that began several years after Lehi and his family left Jerusalem (2 Nephi 1:4).

One possible solution is that these later chapters of Isaiah are actually based on primitive writings of 1st Isaiah, with specific historical details added in (Cyrus, Babylon, etc.). Then when Joseph recognized chapters of Isaiah as he translated the Book of Mormon, he switched to the King James Bible to save time in the translation process. But this solution doesn't align at all with the accounts we have of how the book was translated. All accounts of the translation process are pretty consistent in saying that Joseph would put the seer stone in a hat, place his face in the hat, and read English text from the stone. He did not use notes or a Bible, and he did not even need to have the gold plates in the room with him. To account for the King James text in the Book of Mormon, we have to reject these accounts and accept a "loose translation" theory.

The chapters don't appear *exactly* verbatim; there is a pattern of minor differences that is pretty consistent throughout the Isaiah chapters in 2 Nephi. Often when the sentence could make sense without the italicized words from the KJV, they're removed in the BoM. A good example of this is 2 Nephi 24:32 and Isaiah 14:32: "What shall *one* then answer the messengers of the nations?" is converted to "What shall then answer the messengers of the nations?", which changes the meaning. To me it doesn't feel like these are corrections that demonstrate a more accurate, original version of the Isaiah text.

One really good example where the Book of Mormon gets it wrong is 2 Nephi 12:16:

- Isaiah 2:16 (NRSV): against all the ships of Tarshish, and against all the beautiful craft.
- Isaiah 2:16 (KJV): And upon all the ships of Tarshish, and upon all pleasant pictures.
- 2 Nephi 12:16: And upon all the ships of the sea, and upon all the ships of Tarshish, and upon all pleasant pictures

Biblical scholars agree that the KJV use of the word "pictures" is a mistranslation, but that word appears in the Book of Mormon. But the added phrase about "ships of the sea" doesn't work either. First, "ships of Tarshish" was a common phrase used to refer to ships in general, and second, this chapter is written in *verse*, meaning that in Hebrew these were actually poetic couplets. Having both phrases there messes up the meter of the poetic couplets.

The issue with "pictures" seems to imply that Joseph was either copying directly from the King James Bible or God was giving him the KJV exactly, errors and all. But the added phrase is incorrect and would imply that God was giving him a false correction.

Similar issues occur all over the text, and more discussion is available [here](https://www.ldsdiscussions.com/kjv):

- Jesus' Sermon at the Temple is a slightly modified version of the Sermon on the Mount in Matthew.
  - "Farthing" is changed to "senine" but the metaphor of "compel thee to go a mile" is retained despite not making much sense to the Nephites.
  - "Raca" is Aramaic, not Hebrew, so it shouldn't appear in the Book of Mormon.
- Text from the KJV New Testament is included in the Book of Mormon, some of which is likely not from the original text.
- Slight changes to paraphrased text reflect a lack of understanding of KJV grammar, e.g. 2 Nephi 15:4's use of "wherefore".
- The Victorian English (especially thou vs. you) is misused in places like [Alma 17:11](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/17.11)

### to do

- decide whether I think deutero-Isaiah was written after 600 BCE
  - [ ] read arguments for the one Isaiah theory
  - [ ] study Isaiah with a faithful manual and scholarly one
- decide whether it's ok that the Book of Mormon is not an ancient record but an inspired creation
  - [ ] study what Joseph Smith and the witnesses to the translation process said about the Book of Mormon
  - [ ] study what modern prophets say about the truthfulness of the Book of Mormon

## historical mistakes in the Book of Mormon

One problem with the Book of Mormon narrative is the population growth and relations between the Nephites and Lamanites. In [this article](http://signaturebookslibrary.org/new-approaches-to-the-book-of-mormon-07/), they perform a quick analysis of population growth by selecting moments from the Book of Mormon when numbers of people are reported, and comparing that information with what we know about historical population growth. They also explain why it's unlikely that descendents of Lehi mixed with indigenous people to accomplish such growth. (See 2 Nephi 1 for the prophecy that the land would be preserved for them and kept from all other nations.)

One hole in their analysis is that they fail to consider the effect that strong initial population growth would have on the totals. I think it's plausible that the Lehites could experience big initial population growth if they had lots of natural resources and limited contact with indigenous people during their time in the land of their first inheritance. I should do some math to determine if the numbers would be better supported by a strong initial population growth.

Here are some smaller mistakes in the Book of Mormon:

- Mosiah 1:3-4 says that the plates of brass were written in Egyptian, which is totally unlikely. The Old Testament texts were written in Hebrew.
- In Alma 14:29 Mormon compares Alma and Amulek to lions. This could make sense if he were referring to mountain lions, but I'm not sure what they called them in New York in the 1820s.
- Lots of horses and chariots in Alma 17-20. They're always coupled together, and they're used for travel. Apologists argue that chariots may not have been what we think of as chariots, but we know they were combined with horses in order to travel.

In general, the Book of Mormon looks a lot like a fanciful tale compiled from what New England frontierspeople thought of Native Americans. There is no external history to back up anything the Book of Mormon says, unlike the Bible ([see this Reddit post for discussion of this point](https://www.reddit.com/r/exmormon/comments/k6h0w4/the_absolute_minimum_it_would_take_for_the_book/)).

### to do

- [ ] add the example of solid gold plates from Ether
- [ ] think about population growth in more detail
- [ ] read [Book of Mormon Authorship](https://rsc.byu.edu/book/book-mormon-authorship)
- [ ] find sources about Joseph's time period's interest in the Native Americans
- [ ] find out if the numbers in the Book of Mormon satisfy Benford's law
- [ ] study stylometry of the Book of Mormon (including style drift) (see [this](http://www.withoutend.org/stylistic-drift-book-mormon-dictation/))
- [ ] read about [anachronistic Christian doctrine](https://www.churchistrue.com/blog/anachronistic-christian-doctrine-in-book-of-mormon/) in the Book of Mormon
- [ ] check out this [interview](https://www.mormonstories.org/podcast/applying-higher-criticism-to-mormon-scripture-david-bokovoy/) with David Bokovoy about higher criticism

## narrative complexity in the Book of Mormon

[This interesting document](https://www.docdroid.net/sUW5NhW/book-of-mormon-details-pdf) compiles a huge list of long-range dependencies present in the Book of Mormon that Joseph would have to have kept track of in order to write the Book of Mormon himself. Critics either have to assume that he could remember all such details without notes, or that the several witnesses to the translation process (including Michael Morse, who never joined the church) were all deceived or lying when they said that he had no notes with him as he read from a seer stone inside a hat. One unlikely possibility is that he kept a pre-written manuscript inside his hat, but that seems farfetched. A more likely possibility is that most or all of the translation witnesses were in collusion with the exception of Michael Morse, who was given a false presentation of the translation process, but this again feels like shaky ground to stand on.

This is the one thing about the church that is hard to explain from a critical standpoint.

### to do

- [ ] read this document more carefully
- [ ] study historical sources relating to the translation process of the Book of Mormon

## scriptural literalism in the Book of Mormon

The Book of Mormon takes as literal the stories of the Tower of Babel, the Flood, and Adam and Eve. But these stories weren't well-known before the compilation of Genesis, which didn't happen until the 6th or 5th century BC. These stories are based on similar myths told in the societies close to Israel at that time, and were likely included in the Hebrew canon at that time.

The Tower of Babel is impossible because of what we know about how languages develop and diverge. The Flood is impossible because Noah could not have built an ark that would carry all the animals of the Earth along with all their necessary food for that amount of time. Adam and Eve may have existed, but there were certainly humans existing tens of thousands of years before them. Either those humans didn't have souls, or they didn't exist and we have to believe that "true" humanity has only been around for 6000-7000 years.

### to do

- [ ] improve explanations for the impossibility of these myths

## other translation efforts of Joseph Smith

We don't have all of the papyri that Joseph had when he translated the Book of Abraham, but what we do have left over are just standard Egyptian funerary texts. The interpretations Joseph provided for the facsimiles are definitely wrong though, and those facsimiles are all present on the funerary texts that we still have. Even apologists are often left arguing that Joseph was simply inspired by the presence of the papyri to create a "translation" that he received directly from God. But that translation looks a lot like what you'd expect to appear, given popular opinion of the day about the pseudepigraphal Book of Enoch and about black people being the cursed descendants of Cain. The church now disavows that racist idea, but it's present in the Book of Abraham.

### to do

- [ ] get sources for this
- [ ] read [this](http://jur.byu.edu/?p=21296)

## polygamy

Joseph married 32-38 women, some of whom were only 14 years old. Others were already married (which was forbidden by D&C 132); there are several cases where he sent men off on missions and then married their wives while they were gone. He kept these marriages mostly hidden from Emma, disobeying another requirement from D&C 132.

### to do

- [ ] study this and get sources for it

## the temple

The ordinances of the temple were based on rituals from the Masons, and they have been modified a lot since their revelation. The symbols used in the temple used to be explained as symbolic of the promise that you would first kill yourself rather than reveal the symbols in the temple. The symbols have changed a bit over time to reduce that symbolism.

You aren't even told beforehand what you're promising, and when you're there the only way out is by standing up in front of everyone, near the beginning when the explain some of what you'll promise. No one is going to do that.

### to do

- [ ] study this and get sources for it

## the modern church

The church fosters a culture that socially reinforces belief. We are asked to bear our testimonies, which is a common cult tactic used to reinforce belief ([relevant Reddit comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/exmormon/comments/k67xs1/what_was_the_first_thing_that_started_your_search/gejdpre/)). We are trained (and train our kids) to say "I know" when in fact it is just a belief.

The church spends billions of dollars on building temples, while spending far less on humanitarian efforts. (See [this Reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/exmormon/comments/7lccwv/they_rob_the_poor_because_of_their_fine/) about how we might not need to spend so much on temples.)

- [ ] watch movies about cults to provide a source for "a common cult tactic"
- [ ] study sources on the church's humanitarian efforts
- [ ] look up statistics of suicide for LGBTQ+ members/Utahns
