I have undergone a faith transition. It started very suddenly one day after discovering some information about church history online. Very early on I knew I needed to record my evidence and conclusions somewhere, and there are a few things I want to keep in mind as I write here:

- In all my reading, studying, and thinking since that moment, I've noticed that there is a *lot* of information out there, and it tends to be dumped together all at once as "unequivocal proof" that the church is false. If you add up all of these unlikelihoods, the argument goes, it becomes impossible for the church to be directed by God. This can end up overwhelming reason in a sort of [*argumentum ad nauseam*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof_by_assertion): if you discover that one argument against the church isn't really strong enough to be a problem for you, the attacker can say that that particular argument isn't necessary to support the conclusion because there are all these other arguments. I want to record the facts that lead me to believe that the church is not what it says it is, but I want to narrow it down to just the most compelling issues to make sure I'm not succumbing to *argumentum ad nauseam*.
- I want to be able to back up everything I say with primary sources. Here are examples of what I mean by "primary sources":
  - the source text of the revelatory productions of Joseph Smith
  - journals, letters, and other materials produced by people who were present
  - [Gospel Topics essays](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/manual/gospel-topics/essays?lang=eng) and [general conference talks](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/general-conference?lang=eng), because they're the "party line" of the church
  - scholarly publications describing research experiments, or scholarly discussion with references to the actual experiments
- Church leaders have [often](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/general-conference/2021/04/49nelson?lang=eng) [asked](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/general-conference/2018/10/truth-and-the-plan?lang=eng) us to stick to church-approved sources and arguments when looking at church history. I'm not going to do that, because if the church were fraudulent, the disaffected members would be the ones with the true story. To only look at accounts from those who remained faithful would be [survivorship bias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survivorship_bias). But if, as the church suggests, Satan has put in the hearts of the enemies of the church to create anti-Mormon lies, they will either be lies about facts (i.e. false accounts) or false argumentation. Shady facts can be handled by comparing several accounts and considering the context of the person writing, and shady argumentation can be handled by watching for fallacies and reading both sides of the argument.

In publishing this to a broader audience than just myself, my point is not to disparage the church or the good that it does. I am also not trying to scare believers out of the church with surprising facts. Here is what I hope to demonstrate:

- The method for determining that the church is true is faulty. (spiritual witnesses)
- The church's method for receiving revelation is faulty. (historical issues, modern issues)
- If this church is God's best method for saving us, then he is the author of confusion and does not deserve to be followed. (philosophies of men, morality vs obedience)

## faith and confirmations from the Spirit

>You will not get to know it [whether the Book of Mormon is true] by trying to prove it archaeologically, or by DNA, or by anything else... Religious truth is always confirmed by what you feel. And that’s the way Heavenly Father answers prayers.” (M. Russell Ballard, Mormon Newsroom, Oct 4 2007 ([YouTube](https://youtu.be/3AQTr9oB8lw)))

The church teaches that the way to know the truth is by reading the Book of Mormon and praying to know if it's true. The promise is that if we sincerely want to know then God will manifest the truth of it through the Holy Ghost (see Moroni 10:3-5). The Holy Ghost can feel different for each person (see this [New Era article](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/new-era/2014/06/what-if-i-dont-feel-a-burning-in-the-bosom?lang=eng)), but it generally feels like an inspiring, uplifting, motivating feeling.

My problem is that there are lots of churches, religions, and cults that tell you to discover truth this way. Here's some evidence:

- This [video](https://youtu.be/ycUvC9s4VYA) (14:03) shows some examples of people who feel convinced of the truth of Islam, the RLDS and FLDS churches, and even some strange suicide cults.
- This [video](https://youtu.be/UJMSU8Qj6Go) (13:02) has some more examples of the testimonies of people who've converted to many religions, including mainstream Mormonism. This video has some scenes taken from the previous one.
- This [Preach podcast interview with Satin Tashnizi](https://emeraldproject.org/project/preach-podcast-kuer/) (25:26) investigates her process of converting to Islam. The entire Preach series is a really great look at how religion works for people for reasons that don't necessarily imply truthfulness.
- There are several YouTubers who practice something called [Street Epistemology](https://streetepistemology.com/). "The general goal of Street Epistemology is to help people to reflect on the reasons and methods that they use to conclude that their deeply-held beliefs are true" ([source](https://streetepistemology.com/faq)). These YouTubers interview people with a wide variety of beliefs, asking questions that help the interviewee (and us) understand their reasons for believing what they do. The following videos are pretty demonstrative:
  - [Emily's faith in the Christian God](https://youtu.be/1RbpbWXg_Pw) (24:44)
  - [Madison's belief in the Christian God](https://youtu.be/d5tjfvPysSI) (46:30)
  - [Tia's belief in the Christian God](https://youtu.be/A-M1EyhcRS8) (11:05)
  - [Eric's belief in astrology](https://youtu.be/hl2sOsEL9v4) (minimal language warning) (36:46)
  - [Elder Macedone's belief in the Book of Mormon](https://youtu.be/DhKGiw0ZVBM) (31:43)
  - [Jenny and Anthony's belief in the Book of Mormon](https://youtu.be/bh9IYjRYBx4) (1:01:30)

Many people of many different religions come to their faith by this process of studying and thinking about what is being taught, and then having feelings or experiences they attribute to God that tell them that what they're learning is true. While there are certainly truths and good things in most religions, if the same mechanism is in place for determining the goodness of *any* religion, how does my spiritual witness of the truth of this church confirm to me that this is the *most correct* religion of all? A religion may even *work* for someone---bring them peace, inspire them, teach them---while not being true. Check out this [video](https://youtu.be/6nXDzbxhqfE) (14:59) that makes a strong case for this.

A friend of mine once answered this question by saying that while you can get good feelings due to the truth found in other religions, this is the only religion that invites you to seek out that confirmation by *directly asking God*. This is something I used to really focus on when I was teaching people about the church on my mission. This idea is plausible as long as the answer received is distinct from that of other religions, but the videos I linked above make it pretty clear that's not the case. It's easy to see why this isn't a good test for truth if we compare it to healing from a sickness. Let's say you and I have the same disease, and we both take something different for it and immediately start to feel better. There are four possibilities:

1. Both our remedies cured us from the illness. (both religions are true)
1. Neither of our remedies actually cured us and we just got better naturally. (neither religion is true despite our spiritual witnesses)
1. Yours was a cure but mine was not. (your religion is true but mine is not)
1. Mine was a cure but yours was not. (my religion is true but yours is not)

Case 1 is impossible, so at least one of us is deceived in thinking their remedy was a cure. In this hypothetical, it's easy to see that we would need a different test in order to determine which remedies were cures. If I pray and ask God and then feel that Mormonism is right, how is that different from doing whatever Islam requires of me in order to receive a confirmation, and then feeling that Islam is right in the same way?

Here's an [article from Zelph on the Shelf](https://zelphontheshelf.com/is-god-real-a-response-to-mormon-org/) that does a good job explaining this problem with confirming the truth of the existence of God. Here's a [post on r/exchristian](https://www.reddit.com/r/exchristian/comments/gb687d/but_the_bible_says_so/) arguing that the same standard of proof we require of other gods should be required of our own god.

In the church we talk about how great it is to have both a modern prophet and personal revelation. But there's a problem as soon as we acknowledge the fallibility of both the prophet and our internal sense for truth. As soon as those two sources of truth conflict, we no longer have a clear method of determining truth, and this is important because of real issues like caring for LGBTQ people or protesting systemic racism. A common response to this conflict is to doubt your personal revelation and wonder if sin or imperfect desires leave you mistaken in your perception of the Spirit's promptings. This leaves no room for you to construct a test to determine whether the Spirit actually makes sense at all as an external influence.

In [*Faith is Not Blind*]({{< relref "/book/faith-is-not-blind.md" >}}) Elder and Sister Hafen talk about "a witness more powerful than sight". To them, that witness is the closeness you feel to the Savior when you sacrifice to serve Him. You can see this happen to missionaries both ancient and modern, and I think this happens for religious people regardless of the particular religion.

It was a big realization for me that signs had *not* followed me despite my belief in Jesus Christ, contrary to what [Ether 4:18](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/ether/4.18) promises. And that verse isn't a fluke; Joseph Smith makes the same promise of miracles and signs in Lectures on Faith ([source](https://lecturesonfaith.com/7/#20)), and [Moroni 10:23-25](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/moro/10.23-25) says if we don't see the power of God in our lives then it's because of unbelief and none of us does any good works. As a believer there are two ways to deal with not seeing miracles in your life: you can think your faith is inadequate and blame yourself, or you can see miracles and signs in ordinary events in your life. The human brain is very good at self-doubt and also very good at recognizing meaning in randomness ([source](https://archive.is/20130121151738/http://www.dbskeptic.com/2007/11/04/apophenia-definition-and-analysis/)), so this usually works well enough to get you to ignore the problem.

None of this disproves Mormonism, but it does mean that the method it asks you to use to determine its truthfulness is built on a sandy foundation (see [Matthew 7:26](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/matt/7.26)).

But the world has vastly improved since we decided to become more objective and rely on reason and the scientific method. This [article](https://www.ldsdiscussions.com/testimonies) demonstrates how the messaging of the church uses a host of [human cognitive biases](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_bias) to reinforce faith, including the illusory truth effect ([wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illusory_truth_effect), [source](https://web.archive.org/web/20160515062305/http://www.psych.utoronto.ca/users/hasher/PDF/Frequency%20and%20the%20conference%20Hasher%20et%20al%201977.pdf)), confirmation bias ([wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confirmation_bias)), and the sunk cost fallacy ([wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunk_cost#Fallacy_effect), [source](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/0167268195000453?via%3Dihub)).

Faith takes advantage of our cognitive biases to help us arrive at conclusions that are less likely than conclusions arrived at with rationality.
- This [Reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/exmormon/comments/mkdgsu/just_a_reminder_that_if_something_is_true_you/) points out that in no other area of knowledge do we have to constantly reinforce our belief that something is true. That might be fine, except that other religions have to do the same thing, and it's all based on a few of the same cognitive biases. Street Epistemology videos do a good job demonstrating this.

## inclusions of KJV text in the Book of Mormon

Of the 6604 verses in the 1830 edition of the Book of Mormon ([source](https://github.com/wordtreefoundation/bomdb#align-a-new-book-of-mormon-text-file)), 581 are direct quotations from the KJV Bible and 442 borrow phrases found in the KJV (counting from [this list](http://web.archive.org/web/20201027171536/http://bookofmormondepot.com/kjv-verses/) using `grep -o 'tr class="vq"' bom.html | wc -l` and `grep -o 'tr class="vp"' bom.html | wc -l` respectively).

A great example of the problem with borrowed phrases is [1 Nephi 1:14](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/1.14), which uses the phrase "Great and marvelous are thy works, O Lord God Almighty!". This exact phrase is used in [Revelation 15:3](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/rev/15.3), about 700 years after Lehi uses it. Similarly, both [1 Nephi 13:27](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/13.27) and [Acts 13:10](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/acts/13.10) use the phrase "pervert the right ways of the Lord". Many of the 440 other borrowings are similarly surprising. This implies that the English version of the Book of Mormon was heavily influenced by the exact wording of the KJV.

More evidence of this is found if we look at the chapters quoted from the Bible. The chapters don't appear *exactly* verbatim; there is a pattern of minor differences that is pretty consistent throughout the quoted chapters. Often when the sentence could make sense without the italicized words from the KJV, they're removed in the BoM. A good example of this is [2 Nephi 24:32](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/24.32) and [Isaiah 14:32](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/isa/14.32): "What shall *one* then answer the messengers of the nations?" is converted to "What shall then answer the messengers of the nations?", which changes "messengers" into the subject instead of the object of the sentence. Italicized words are removed approximately 40 times more often than non-italicized words ([source](https://web.archive.org/web/20210213130210/https://journal.interpreterfoundation.org/missing-words-king-james-bible-italics-the-translation-of-the-book-of-mormon-and-joseph-smith-as-an-unlearned-reader/), p. 53). These don't look like corrections that demonstrate a more accurate, original version of the Isaiah text, but rather they demonstrate a 19th century understanding of "Bible errors". The common view at the time was that "the old and new testaments are filled with errors, obscurities, **italics** and contradictions, which must be the work of men" (from *The Evening and the Morning Star* in 1833 as cited [here](https://web.archive.org/web/20210213130210/https://journal.interpreterfoundation.org/missing-words-king-james-bible-italics-the-translation-of-the-book-of-mormon-and-joseph-smith-as-an-unlearned-reader/), p. 58; emphasis mine).

The [article](https://web.archive.org/web/20210213130210/https://journal.interpreterfoundation.org/missing-words-king-james-bible-italics-the-translation-of-the-book-of-mormon-and-joseph-smith-as-an-unlearned-reader/) cited above (from the Interpreter Foundation) argues that the differences between the Book of Mormon and KJV point to Joseph reading (through the seer stone) a version of the KJV with the italicized words removed, but why would God show Joseph such a translation when we know now that nearly all cases of italicized words reflect a better interpretation of the Bible in English? The article argues that *not* removing the italicized words would have confused 19th-century readers who believed the italics were problematic. But the Book of Mormon claims the Bible has lost "many parts which are plain and most precious" ([1 Nephi 13:26](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/13.26)) and its express purpose is to restore those truths (see [1 Nephi 13:34-36](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/13.34-36)). Instead of adding errors to the quoted Bible passages to adapt for 19th-century readers' intellectual ease, you'd think God could have taken the opportunity to provide a more accurate translation, or at least not worse than the KJV.

One really good example where the Book of Mormon gets it wrong is 2 Nephi 12:16:

- Isaiah 2:16 (NRSV): against all the ships of Tarshish, and against all the beautiful craft.
- Isaiah 2:16 (KJV): And upon all the ships of Tarshish, and upon all pleasant pictures.
- 2 Nephi 12:16: And upon all the ships of the sea, and upon all the ships of Tarshish, and upon all pleasant pictures.

Biblical scholars agree that the KJV use of the word "pictures" is a mistranslation ([source](https://web.archive.org/web/20200709051157/https://scholarsarchive.byu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1377&context=jbms), p. 17-19), but that word appears in the Book of Mormon. The added phrase about "ships of the sea" doesn't work either. This chapter is written in *verse*, meaning that in Hebrew these were actually poetic couplets. Having both phrases there messes up the meter and meaning of the poetic couplets ([source](https://web.archive.org/web/20200709051157/https://scholarsarchive.byu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1377&context=jbms), p. 16). Now, consider these two bits of information in tandem:

1. The issue with "pictures" seems to imply that Joseph was either copying directly from the King James Bible or God was giving him some version of the text close to the KJV, including errors.
1. It could be that having the two phrases about "ships of Tarshish/the sea" is the original, and a copying error was made between the time when Nephi got the brass plates (600 BC) and when the Dead Sea scrolls were produced (ca. 125 BC ([source](http://dss.collections.imj.org.il/isaiah))). (The authors of the above [source](https://web.archive.org/web/20200709051157/https://scholarsarchive.byu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1377&context=jbms) posit that the line "and upon all pleasant pictures" could be a concluding line that pairs with the introductory line added in the Book of Mormon in verse 13 (p. 24). But it seems highly unlikely that those distant paired lines would *both* be lost due to a copying error.)

The appearance of "pictures" seems to imply that the translation process was somehow referring to the KJV, and the addition of "ships of the sea" implies that the translation process involved incorrect changes to the text.

Similar issues occur all over the Book of Mormon and demonstrate that Joseph was working from the KJV:

- Slight changes to paraphrased text reflect a misunderstanding of KJV grammar, e.g. [2 Nephi 15:4](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/15.4)'s use of "wherefore" as an introduction rather than a question word as it is used in the KJV [Isaiah 5:4](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/isa/5.4). (The punctuation in the Book of Mormon was added by the printer ([source](https://web.archive.org/web/20210122043157/https://history.churchofjesuschrist.org/content/museum/the-book-of-mormon-from-manuscript-to-press?lang=eng)), but "it" and "brought" swap places to change the question into a statement.)
- Jesus' Sermon at the Temple is clearly modified from the KJV Sermon on the Mount in Matthew.
  - "Raca" is Aramaic, not Hebrew, so it shouldn't appear *in Aramaic* in [3 Nephi 12:22](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/12.22) because the Nephites wouldn't have been culturally familiar with Aramaic. It seems unlikely that the word was brought by Lehi and his family and remained unaltered for 600 years.
  - "Farthing" is changed to "senine" in [3 Nephi 12:26](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/12.26) but "compel thee to go a mile" is retained in [v. 41](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/12.41) despite the Nephites not being familiar with the mile (a Roman unit of distance).
  - The phrase "by them of old time" is problematic in [3 Nephi 12:27](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/12.27):

    - Matthew 5:27 (NRSV): You have heard that it was said, "You shall not commit adultery."
    - Matthew 5:27 (KJV): You have heard that it was said *by them of old time*, Thou shalt not commit adultery:
    - 3 Nephi 12:27: Behold, it is written *by them of old time*, that thou shalt not commit adultery;

    This phrase is translated from *τοῖς ἀρχαίοις* (*tois archaiois*), but those words are not present in the early manuscripts of the Greek New Testament. Furthermore, the KJV mistranslates this as "*by* them of old time" when it would really be "*to* them of old time".

## historical mistakes in the Book of Mormon

One problem with the Book of Mormon narrative is the population growth and relations between the Nephites and Lamanites. In [this article](http://signaturebookslibrary.org/new-approaches-to-the-book-of-mormon-07/), they perform a quick analysis of population growth by selecting moments from the Book of Mormon when numbers of people are reported, and comparing that information with what we know about historical population growth. They also explain why it's unlikely that descendents of Lehi mixed with indigenous people to accomplish such growth. (See 2 Nephi 1 for the prophecy that the land would be preserved for them and kept from all other nations.)

One hole in their analysis is that they fail to consider the effect that strong initial population growth would have on the totals. I think it's plausible that the Lehites could experience big initial population growth if they had lots of natural resources and limited contact with indigenous people during their time in the land of their first inheritance. I should do some math to determine if the numbers would be better supported by a strong initial population growth.

Here are some smaller mistakes in the Book of Mormon:

- Mosiah 1:3-4 says that the plates of brass were written in Egyptian, which is totally unlikely. The Old Testament texts were written in Hebrew. (TODO add more info and original sources ([here?](https://www.reddit.com/r/mormon/comments/l5l24f/brass_plates_in_egyptian/))to prove why this makes sense in Joseph's time and why it makes no sense for Lehi and Nephi.)
- In Alma 14:29 Mormon compares Alma and Amulek to lions. This could make sense if he were referring to mountain lions, but I'm not sure what they called them in New York in the 1820s.
- Lots of horses and chariots in Alma 17-20. They're always coupled together, and they're used for travel. Apologists argue that chariots may not have been what we think of as chariots, but we know they were combined with horses in order to travel.

In general, the Book of Mormon looks a lot like a fanciful tale compiled from what New England frontierspeople thought of Native Americans. There is no external history to back up anything the Book of Mormon says, unlike the Bible ([see this Reddit post for discussion of this point](https://www.reddit.com/r/exmormon/comments/k6h0w4/the_absolute_minimum_it_would_take_for_the_book/)).

## narrative complexity in the Book of Mormon

[This interesting document](https://www.docdroid.net/sUW5NhW/book-of-mormon-details-pdf) compiles a huge list of long-range dependencies present in the Book of Mormon that Joseph would have to have kept track of in order to write the Book of Mormon himself. Critics either have to assume that he could remember all such details without notes, or that the several witnesses to the translation process (including Michael Morse, who never joined the church) were all deceived or lying when they said that he had no notes with him as he read from a seer stone inside a hat. One unlikely possibility is that he kept a pre-written manuscript inside his hat, but that seems farfetched. A more likely possibility is that most or all of the translation witnesses were in collusion with the exception of Michael Morse, who was given a false presentation of the translation process, but this again feels like shaky ground to stand on.

This is the one thing about the church that is hard to explain from a critical standpoint.

### to do

- [ ] read this document more carefully
- [ ] study historical sources relating to the translation process of the Book of Mormon

## scriptural literalism in the Book of Mormon

The Book of Mormon takes as literal the stories of the Tower of Babel, the Flood, and Adam and Eve. But these stories weren't well-known before the compilation of Genesis, which didn't happen until the 6th or 5th century BC. These stories are based on similar myths told in the societies close to Israel at that time, and were likely included in the Hebrew canon at that time.

The Tower of Babel is impossible because of what we know about how languages develop and diverge. The Flood is impossible because Noah could not have built an ark that would carry all the animals of the Earth along with all their necessary food for that amount of time. Adam and Eve may have existed, but there were certainly humans existing tens of thousands of years before them. Either those humans didn't have souls, or they didn't exist and we have to believe that "true" humanity has only been around for 6000-7000 years.

### to do

- [ ] improve explanations for the impossibility of these myths

## the First Vision

The First Vision is confusing because:

- There are four different accounts that contradict one another, and the story tends to be embellished over time.
- Earlier accounts do not reference the visit of both God the Father and Jesus Christ as two individuals, which lines up with the trinitarian view that Joseph Smith had at the beginning of his prophetic career. It also lines up with the trinitarian language present in the earliest version of the Book of Mormon.

## to do

- [ ] get sources for this
- [ ] turn this into a section about how Joseph often used revelations and visions when they were useful

## "Where did he come up with the doctrine?"

This is a common argument for divine origin of the Book of Mormon.

### to do

- [ ] read On Bullshit

## other translation efforts of Joseph Smith

We don't have all of the papyri that Joseph had when he translated the Book of Abraham, but what we do have left over are just standard Egyptian funerary texts. The interpretations Joseph provided for the facsimiles are definitely wrong though, and those facsimiles are all present on the funerary texts that we still have. Even apologists are often left arguing that Joseph was simply inspired by the presence of the papyri to create a "translation" that he received directly from God. But that translation looks a lot like what you'd expect to appear, given popular opinion of the day about the pseudepigraphal Book of Enoch and about black people being the cursed descendants of Cain. The church now disavows that racist idea, but it's present in the Book of Abraham.

### to do

- read Joseph Smith: Rough Stone Rolling
- [ ] get sources for this
- [ ] read [this](http://jur.byu.edu/?p=21296)
- think about these notes from a Mormon Stories interview with Jim Bennett:
  - The changing in Joseph's theology from trinitarian to split is reflected in the Lectures on Faith, the Book of Mormon, and the First Vision accounts. That's a simple, strong case.
  - With Jim Bennett, you have to believe that Joseph was making up all these authenticity stories (Abraham, Kinderhook plates, etc.) and believing them, but that they were incorrect stories.
  - Joseph likely wasn't an intentional fraud, but we know for a fact that he said some things that were false about what he was doing.

## polygamy

Joseph married 32-38 women, some of whom were only 14 years old. Others were already married (which was forbidden by D&C 132); there are several cases where he sent men off on missions and then married their wives while they were gone. He kept these marriages mostly hidden from Emma, disobeying another requirement from D&C 132. Would he really be so hesitant to do polygamy for so long (thus keeping things secret) but at the same time go overkill and marry women who are already married, a mistake according to D&C 132?

### to do

- [ ] study this and get sources for it

## the temple

The ordinances of the temple were based on rituals from the Masons, and they have been modified a lot since their revelation. The symbols used in the temple used to be explained as symbolic of the promise that you would first kill yourself rather than reveal the symbols in the temple. The symbols have changed a bit over time to reduce that symbolism.

You aren't even told beforehand what you're promising, and when you're there the only way out is by standing up in front of everyone, near the beginning when they explain some of what you'll promise. No one is going to do that.

## the modern church

The faith-reinforcing teachings and culture of the church are common to other faiths and especially high-demand religions. The documentary "Going Clear: Scientology and the Prison of Belief" ([YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLLKsMxPqn0)) demonstrates that other high-demand religions use similar tactics to get people to keep *themselves* within the faith.

- We are asked to bear our testimonies, which is a common cult tactic used to reinforce belief ([relevant Reddit comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/exmormon/comments/k67xs1/what_was_the_first_thing_that_started_your_search/gejdpre/)). We are trained (and train our kids) to say "I know" when in fact it is just a belief. President Boyd Packer taught that "a testimony is to be found in the bearing of it". (See [this blog post](https://www.patheos.com/blogs/faithpromotingrumor/2010/12/revisiting-a-testimony-is-to-be-found-in-the-bearing-of-it/) for a valuable discussion of the context of this quote.)
- The way Miscavage (second leader of Scientology) talks about preaching Scientology is designed to threaten you into guilt over it. "When your head hits the pillow, can you rest easy knowing you've done enough?"
- Another tool shared between Scientology and Mormonism is demonstrated in this quote from an ex-Scientologist: "Scientology was really good at getting you to feel like a scoundrel." In both Mormonism and Scientology, rules and confession to breaking those rules are used to make the believer feel that any unhappiness they feel in the religion is their own fault due to disobedience, rather than an external issue. This is much more strongly used in Scientology but is still present in Mormonism.
- In a 2018 conference talk entitled "Truth and the Plan" ([link](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/general-conference/2018/10/truth-and-the-plan)), President Oaks talked about discovering religious truth. Here's one quote that really bothered me: "We should not consider secular prominence or authority as qualified sources of truth." This is a classic conspiracy tactic designed to get you to reject other sources of knowledge. I used to be comfortable with using the epistemology of science for scientific things and the epistemology of faith for religious things, but one thing us religious people have often ignored is that true things can withstand scrutiny from all valid truth-seeking approaches. We may not be able to scientifically determine if God exists, but we can perform linguistic studies of the Book of Mormon text to discover if it relies on 19th century books available to Joseph Smith. "What we know will always trump what we do not know" is problematic when it causes us to reject information that ought to modify our working hypothesis.

The church spends billions of dollars on building temples, while spending far less on humanitarian efforts. (See [this Reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/exmormon/comments/7lccwv/they_rob_the_poor_because_of_their_fine/) about how we might not need to spend so much on temples.)

- These prophets don't look like prophets. We can look at the misguided morals of past prophets and excuse them by noting that they were of a different time, but that's moral relativism (which the church abhors). The church isn't ahead on social issues, but it isn't ahead on morality or or the Atonement either! Prophets really only provide "prophetic morality". They don't predict future events. They are supposed to just give us the inside scope on God's thoughts about moral action. When these prophets don't even give moral guidance that stands the test of time, but actually fight against moral progress, you know they are not Godly, just powerful and holding on to that power.
