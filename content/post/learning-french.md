Here I'm going to document my efforts to learn French. I speak Spanish pretty well, which together with English gives me a strong base for comprehension.

- **2021-08-01**: I started using Duolingo every day, and got into the XP challenges to the point where I was getting like hundreds of points most days. I've currently (2022-06-01) got 15821 XP and 103 lesson crowns in the French course, and most of that came from Fall 2021. That really gave me a good sense for basic grammar and function words.
- **2021-08-18**: I [moved to Québec]({{< relref "québec" >}}) and started experiencing the French language multiple times a week.
- **2021-09-01**: The fall semester started at UdeM, so the number of emails (in French) from the university increased dramatically.
- **2021-10-06**: I was assigned a speaking partner by the [programme de jumelage interlinguistique](http://www.ahc.umontreal.ca/ActivitesJumelage/interlinguistique.htm), and we started meeting weekly to practice speaking (her English and me French). This was the first time I was actually producing output, which was scary but fun.
- **2022-01-15**: I stopped using Duolingo as often because it feels repetitive and this semester I'm planning to write an app to study vocab more directly.
- **2022-02-01**: My French speaking partner finished her program and moved back to France, so we stopped meeting (although we do plan to continue calling once she's done traveling).
- **2022-04-27**: I finished the alpha version of the [WordBurner app]({{< relref "wordburner" >}}) and gave it to friends and family to test. I used it myself for about a week, and it felt like a very time-efficient way to increase vocabulary especially at the beginning. It's rough around the edges in terms of the example sentences and the card recurrence was off, so I stopped using it after the semester project was over.
- **2022-05-03**: I started attending a weekly [French conversation workshop](https://www.amilia.com/store/fr/celo/shop/activities/3823518) at the local community center.
- **2022-05-29**: We listened to the first episode of the Duolingo French podcast, and really enjoyed it. We understood like probably 40% of what the French speaker was saying, thanks to the context provided by the English-speaking host. This seems like a great way to get interesting input at a level we can understand.
