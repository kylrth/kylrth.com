Do I like my ward? Do I find community?

I believe that anyone who reevaluates their relationship with their religion has to go through a period of anger. For a few months, what mattered to me was proving Mormonism wrong. I wanted to be certain of it, so that then I could put a hard stop to my practice of Mormonism and begin to move on.

I don't think Mormonism is God's true religion on earth. At this point I feel fully intellectually out. If I ever get exposed to something that'll make me reconsider, I'm open to that, because I loved the promises of the church and really wanted them to be true. But I don't think that's going to happen.

While listening to [this podcast interview](https://www.scholarsandsaints.net/1298003/7059058-producing-ancient-scripture-w-michael-hubbard-mackay-and-mark-ashurst-mcgee) with the editors of [*Producing Ancient Scripture*](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/49415714-producing-ancient-scripture), I realized that studying church history is so much more fulfilling and interesting when I'm not worried about its implications for the church's truth claims. Despite my disbelief, I've found that I really enjoy the study and the experience of Mormonism. As I've learned about church history (and religious history in general), I've been able to see better my own motivations and shortcomings through the lens of history.

I used to be frustrated that I had been "under the thumb" of the church for so long, that they had extorted me for my money and time. While I plan on eventually making modifications to my religious practice, I'm happy to continue participating in the church because it gives me the chance to discuss morals and family-raising with others, and it gives me the opportunity to participate in a community that works well for me.{{% sidenote %}}I recognize that the community of the church works well for me because I am a heterosexual white male who grew up in the church with a healthy, happy family and never had financial stress.{{% /sidenote %}} At the same time, I am also not going to lie or pretend to believe things that I do not. I don't need to subscribe to anything that I see as nonsensical or of little value, and I can recognize the shortcomings of the community and try to help.

- quote from a Preach interview with a Catholic nun: "Faith is like riding a river. ... It's a mindset you have; it's an attitude toward something; like you're a scientist so you gonna pursue something that's a hunch or it's a theory and you're gonna work to prove your hypothesis. It sets you on a path. Faith sets you on a path to try to look past, as best you can, just the veneer of life."

- this thought I had: "The church doesn't really bring anything useful to the table. It doesn't advise anything about morality today, like whether day trading is bad, new addictions to avoid (and how to avoid them), real marriage advice, etc. Their advice on all of that is not unique."

- This [Mormon Stories interview](https://youtu.be/aXOSH5eM7tM) gives a good view of how the church brings good and bad things, and some of the good helps solve the bad it creates
- Mormonism is even more of a Pascal's mugging than the rest of Christianity because it places the exaltation of your whole family on whether it's true or not.
- What's missing when you leave the church is the community and the tools you give to kids. How can we replace those? [challenge journals](https://challengejournals.com)?

- It's a relatively new idea to identify ourselves according to our beliefs about things (communist, capitalist, deist, atheist, liberal, etc.). I want to be careful about the terms I use to identify myself, because I don't hold all of my beliefs with 100% confidence. So I might choose not to identify as atheist, even though I don't think that any of the religions are likely to be right.
- Antimormonism feels so harmful and antagonistic because it IS antagonizing a culture that's just as valid as any other. Just because it's historically problematic doesn't mean it's not a valid culture and religion.

- Bokovoy, in his Mormon Stories interview part 3:
  - on religion:

    > My religion is love. My religion is service. My religion is the development of the mind. My religion is learning to care for other human beings as much as we care for ourselves. My religion is learning to care for the environment. Mormonism provides me with a community and a faith group to practice my religion. If Mormonism isn't working for you, I'm not going to make you go to church. But we'll have to find other ways to live our religion.

  - Prophets in the Old Testament are social critics who are outside the religious/political structure.
  - In pt. 4 he talks about how the early Christian view of Jesus as the Son of God changes drastically.

    > The Hebrew Bible is a library from ancient Israel and there are contradictions that are intentional. I like to point students... for example you know the horrific ban that God orders in Joshua and several other places in the Hebrew Bible. He commands the Israelites to eradicate every man, woman, and child, and kill the beasts of the community as well; slaughter everything. It's horrific; it's terrible, and certainly not my view of what would be inspired. But then there's the Book of Jonah. The Book of Jonah, in many ways, reacts to that view, and says "no no no no, God isn't that way. God is gracious; he is loving even to Israel's enemies, even to the sparing of the cattle of the city." And that's what happens then in the Book of Jonah so you have a totally different view of God. So if you're going to take from my perspective a "manual" approach to the Bible and say ok so the Bible says this about God therefore that is true, or the Bible says we should do this, therefore that is true, you're going to run into problems, because the Bible is a library of material written over a 1000 year time period with very different theological views. Even God is not portrayed the same way, anthropomorphically or whatever.

  - He sees the church as a good place for people just like any other religion can be a good place. If I can't see Mormons as good or the Mormon church as somewhat good, I'm in error.
  - The lack of scriptural historicity isn't a problem for him because you can learn from the books, but the real problem is the social issues now. For me, literalism is a problem and implies the truth claims aren't what the church says they are. That plus the social issues *are* my problem.
