*These are some thoughts I've had while listening to a Lex Fridman [interview](https://lexfridman.com/edward-frenkel/) with Edward Frenkel, a mathematician at UC Berkeley working on mathematical quantum physics.*

In the information age, we like to see everything as computation. But what do we mean when we say that something is computation? We mean that a physical system with predictable interactions has a meaningful result. If we somehow learned that the universe was computational in nature, the only thing that adds is that the universe's state is meaningful somehow.

Calling something computation is a subjective claim because it depends on whether some subject extracts meaning from the state of the universe. I think I've always seen the universe as computational in nature, and to me that implied that everything in it was predictable and understandable. But the universe might be incomprehensible to a human, but comprehensible to another subject. Or it could be incomprehensible to any subject.

Paradoxes and confusion arise from our lenses on reality. We find the wave-particle duality of light interesting because of the distinction between our human notions of wave and particle. Behavior is behavior, and light behaves like light. The duality is in our understanding of light, not the light itself.

There are questions about reality that can't be answered, mostly around subjectivity. To Frenkel this makes the universe ineffable. Math claims to be objective, but hides its subjectivity in the axioms of the formal system. GoÌˆdel's incompleteness theorem and the halting problem demonstrate that there are facts about the universe that we won't be able to arrive at rationally. And then there's all the subjectivity inherent in quantum physics.

We've known about a lot of this for about a century, and yet still the culture of science hasn't really dealt with it. We still talk as though everything is billiard balls, and free will is an illusion, while at the same time acknowledging on paper the fundamental subjectivity of reality, consciousness, etc.
