    <p>I'm a computer science PhD student at <a href="https://diro.umontreal.ca/accueil/">DIRO</a>
        at the <a href="https://www.umontreal.ca/">Université de Montréal</a> studying machine
        learning and NLP. I am advised by <a href="https://www-labs.iro.umontreal.ca/~liubang/">Bang
            Liu</a>.</p>
    <p>Previously I was a speech scientist at <a href="https://cobaltspeech.com">Cobalt Speech &
            Language</a>, a company that designs custom speech recognition, text-to-speech, and
        dialogue models. While at Cobalt I worked on some neat projects, including language modeling
        for recognizing air traffic control speech and creating an online training system for ASR
        models.</p>
    <p>I graduated from <a href="https://byu.edu">BYU</a> with a BS in Applied and Computational
        Mathematics (<a href="https://acme.byu.edu">ACME</a>) with an emphasis in linguistics and a
        minor in computer science. ACME's rigorous curriculum includes graduate-level courses in
        algorithms, analysis, optimization, statistics, data science, optimal control, and machine
        learning.</p>
    <p>During my undergrad I interned with Cobalt Speech, as well as <a
            href="https://emergenttrading.com">Emergent Trading</a>, an automated trading firm that
        <a
            href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/futures-exchange-reins-in-runaway-trading-algorithms-11572377375">made
            the news</a> for reporting a problem in a Eurodollar exchange rule that unfairly favored
        larger competitors. (I developed the analysis tools that were used to track the issue down
        and determine how our opponent was taking advantage of the rule.)

    My first foray into ML research was when I received a grant to apply a variable-order CRF model
    to a morphological parsing task in Basque, <a href="http://jur.byu.edu/?p=24280">achieving</a>
    71.3% accuracy. A few months later I started working with the <a
        href="https://camacholab.byu.edu/research/computational-photonics">computational
        photonics</a> group at <a href="https://camacholab.byu.edu/">CamachoLab</a>, where I worked
    to simulate photonic components using DNNs as replacements for expensive FDTD simulations when
    designing chip components.

    In my spare time I'm working on an <b>app for language learners</b> to use to develop their
    vocabulary. Users can add words to their active list, and the app will recommend additional
    words that they might also want to learn. I hope this app will make it easier for displaced
    people to adapt to the culture where they find themselves, even when their language skills are
    intermediate or advanced.
</p>
<p>Here are some projects I've worked on:</p>
<a href="https://github.com/kylrth/attention_review/blob/master/main.pdf"><img
        src="images/attention.png" alt="attention graph for a sample sentence in NMT"
        style="float:left;width:30%;padding:0 20px 0 0"></a>
<div style="overflow:hidden">
    <a href="https://github.com/kylrth/attention_review/blob/master/main.pdf">
        <papertitle>an attention review</papertitle>
    </a>
    <p>
        I felt I had a poor understanding of attention mechanisms, so for a writing assignment I
        created a literature review of the important work being done with neural attention. I wrote
        about the various formulations of attention found in the literature, and discussed important
        applications. I learned a lot as I studied this. You can check out my write-up <a
            href="https://github.com/kylrth/attention_review/blob/master/main.pdf">here</a>.

    <p>
        <i>speech2phone</i> was a class project I worked on with two other ACME students our senior
        year. We tried to tackle the problem of phoneme recognition on the TIMIT corpus by splitting
        it into the tasks of segmentation and classification. We had some fun exploring various
        algorithms and architectures. We didn't yet have a good sense for the current state of the
        art research and so we sort of threw everything at the problem and watched what happened.
        You can see the repo <a href="https://github.com/jarednielsen/speech2phone">here</a> and the
        final report <a
            href="https://github.com/jarednielsen/speech2phone/blob/master/results/winter_semester_report.pdf">here</a>.

    <p>
        SLURM_gen makes it easy to generate and handle arbitrarily-sized
        datasets on a SLURM HPC environment. I used this tool during my
        undergrad while working on computational photonics research. (I used
        the BYU supercomputer to generate FDTD simulations, which were then
        used as training data for the neural network model.)
