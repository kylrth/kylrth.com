                                recognition, text-to-speech, and dialogue models. While at Cobalt
                                I've worked on some neat projects, including language modeling for
                                recognizing air traffic control speech and creating an online

                                applying to PhD programs in computer science, to start in 2021. See

                            <p>I love using math and code to solve complex problems. I wrote my

                                love for software. I graduated from <a

                                Computational Mathematics (<a href="https://acme.byu.edu">ACME</a>)
                                with an emphasis in linguistics and a minor in computer science.
                                (ACME coursework focuses on the rigorous math for data science,
                                modeling, optimal control, and machine learning.)</p>

                                My first foray into ML research was when I received a grant to apply
                                a variable-order CRF model to a morphological parsing task in
                                Basque, <a href="http://jur.byu.edu/?p=24280">achieving</a> 71.3%
                                accuracy. A few months later I started working with the <a
                                    href="https://camacholab.byu.edu/research/computational-photonics">computational
                                    photonics</a> group at <a
                                    href="https://camacholab.byu.edu/">CamachoLab</a>, where I
                                worked to simulate photonic components using DNNs as replacements
                                for expensive FDTD simulations when designing chip components.

                            <p>Here are some of my current interests:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>I'm curious about the <b>relationship between representation</b>
                                    (how intelligence thinks) <b>and language</b> (how intelligence
                                    communicates). I think if we can improve our understanding of
                                    how humans learn and use language, we will come closer to
                                    understanding the tools necessary to build the "system 2
                                    cognitive abilities" that Yoshua Bengio has <a

                                        about</a>.</li>
                                <li>My most important moral principle is <b>helping others</b>,
                                    especially those who are marginalized or impoverished. I think
                                    there are many social problems that can be solved with machine
                                    learning. I get most passionate about helping refugees and
                                    migrants, reducing language barriers, and improving racial and
                                    cultural inequality.</li>
                                <li>attention mechanisms (see <a

                                In my spare time I'm working on an <b>app for language learners</b>
                                can use to develop their vocabulary. Users can add words to their
                                active list, and the app will recommend additional words that they
                                might also want to learn. I hope this app will make it easier for
                                displaced people to adapt to the culture where they find themselves,
                                even when their language skills are intermediate or advanced.

                                created a literature review of the important work being done with
                                neural attention.
                                I wrote about the various formulations of attention found in the
                                literature, and
                                discussed important applications. I learned a lot as I studied this.

                                <i>speech2phone</i> was a class project I worked on with two other
                                ACME students our senior year. We tried to tackle the problem of
                                phoneme recognition on the TIMIT corpus by splitting it into the
                                tasks of segmentation and classification. We had some fun exploring
                                various algorithms and architectures. We didn't yet have a good
                                sense for the current state of the art research and so we sort of
                                threw everything at the problem and watched what happened. You can
                                see the repo <a

                                SLURM_gen makes it easy to generate and handle arbitrarily-sized
                                datasets on a SLURM HPC environment. I used this tool during my
                                undergrad while working on computational photonics research. (I used
                                the BYU supercomputer to generate FDTD simulations, which were then
                                used as training data for the neural network model.)
