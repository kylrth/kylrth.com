writing technology permalink DYT: You know, it took humans like centuries to perfect the technology of a dictionary and it took hundreds, thousands of people, probably like millions of hours to actually get to the point where you can easily look up a word.</description></item><item><title>thoughts on technology ownership</title><link>https://kylrth.com/post/tech-ownership/</link><pubDate>Thu, 07 Sep 2023 12:11:06 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://kylrth.com/post/tech-ownership/</guid><description>Having heard about the terrible privacy policies of car manufacturers and Ford&amp;rsquo;s new patent to automate vehicle repossession, I was finally able to formulate some thoughts I&amp;rsquo;ve had brewing for a while about ownership in this world of ubiquitous computing.
Before the industrial revolution, humans could essentially understand what a thing did by looking at it, and ownership was about possession of the object. Now we don&amp;rsquo;t understand our tools, and so possession does not imply control.</description></item><item><title>the NYT AI explainer misses the point</title><link>https://kylrth.com/post/nyt-ai-explainer/</link><pubDate>Mon, 17 Apr 2023 10:07:35 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://kylrth.com/post/nyt-ai-explainer/</guid><description>In late March 2023, the NYT released a series of explainer articles about AI. The first article in the seriesYou can also read it on Archive.org if you don&amp;rsquo;t have a subscription. characterizes the recent history of AI as a progression of new technological ideas appearing over time. Of course that&amp;rsquo;s partially true, but it gets the order wrong and misses important non-technical events that are key to understanding our current position.</description></item><item><title>the inherent subjectivity of reality</title><link>https://kylrth.com/post/edward-frenkel/</link><pubDate>Fri, 14 Apr 2023 14:45:44 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://kylrth.com/post/edward-frenkel/</guid><description>These are some thoughts I&amp;rsquo;ve had while listening to a Lex Fridman interview with Edward Frenkel, a mathematician at UC Berkeley working on mathematical quantum physics.
In the information age, we like to see everything as computation. But what do we mean when we say that something is computation? We mean that a physical system with predictable interactions has a meaningful result. If we somehow learned that the universe was computational in nature, the only thing that adds is that the universe&amp;rsquo;s state is meaningful somehow.</description></item><item><title>for a socially beneficial and responsible development of AI</title><link>https://kylrth.com/post/bengio-crawford/</link><pubDate>Mon, 20 Mar 2023 14:04:51 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://kylrth.com/post/bengio-crawford/</guid><description>These are my notes from a conversation between Yoshua Bengio and Kate Crawford held at Mila on 2023-03-20, announcing the release of a new book created as a joint report between Mila and UNESCO called Missing links in AI governance (link). There were news articles in French (Le Devoir), but not as many in English unfortunately (Datanami).
Bengio: What motivates you to do what you do? This topic has turned from an academic move to a societal one really quickly, and it&amp;rsquo;s scary.</description></item><item><title>the AI art debate</title><link>https://kylrth.com/post/ai-art/</link><pubDate>Wed, 08 Mar 2023 12:09:25 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://kylrth.com/post/ai-art/</guid><description>On 2022-11-03 a class action lawsuit was announced against GitHub Copilot on the basis of copyright infringement, and now (2023-01-13) there&amp;rsquo;s one for stable diffusion (against StabilityAI and friends). Browsing through r/StableDiffusion, I&amp;rsquo;m seeing lots of posts like this making the very memeable point that 5 billion images can&amp;rsquo;t be stored in a 4 GB model.

When knowledge is new, it sometimes only comes back to me when I&amp;rsquo;m in the right context. For example, right now I can only think vaguely of how to adjust a chain derailleur on a bike, but I know that if I walked up to my bike and looked closely at the derailleur some more knowledge would appear.</description></item><item><title>thoughts on Effective Altruism</title><link>https://kylrth.com/post/effective-altruism/</link><pubDate>Thu, 17 Nov 2022 15:53:44 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://kylrth.com/post/effective-altruism/</guid><description>Thanks to the crash of FTX and Scott Aaronson&amp;rsquo;s subsequent post about SBF, I read a very interesting deep-dive into Effective Altruism by the New Yorker. I&amp;rsquo;m seeing a lot of important characters show up that I&amp;rsquo;ve seen before: Eliezer Yudkowsky, earn-to-donate, 80,000 hours, etc. It&amp;rsquo;s really fascinating to see this all coming together in one narrative so I can understand a little better the inspiration for these ideas and the way that the movement has interacted with the world up till now.</description></item><item><title>the effects of scale on worst-group performance</title><link>https://kylrth.com/post/worst-group-scale/</link><pubDate>Mon, 18 Jul 2022 15:31:12 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://kylrth.com/post/worst-group-scale/</guid><description>I think it&amp;rsquo;s valuable to be working in the open whenever possible, so I&amp;rsquo;m going to keep my research notes here. These notes will hopefully be full of good (and bad) ideas, so if someone borrows a good idea and publishes on it, that&amp;rsquo;s great!
This post contains my research notes as I try to understand how model scaling affects worst-group performance. This started as a group project in the neural scaling laws course at Mila in winter 2022.</description></item><item><title>learning French</title><link>https://kylrth.com/post/learning-french/</link><pubDate>Wed, 01 Jun 2022 12:19:08 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://kylrth.com/post/learning-french/</guid><description>Here I&amp;rsquo;m going to document my efforts to learn French. I speak Spanish pretty well, which together with English gives me a strong base for comprehension.
2021-08-01: I started using Duolingo every day, and got into the XP challenges to the point where I was getting like hundreds of points most days. I&amp;rsquo;ve currently (2022-06-01) got 15821 XP and 103 lesson crowns in the French course, and most of that came from Fall 2021.</description></item><item><title>WordBurner beta</title><link>https://kylrth.com/post/wordburner/</link><pubDate>Mon, 18 Apr 2022 23:08:52 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://kylrth.com/post/wordburner/</guid><description>Update 2022-04-27: The beta is over, but the apk is still installable with the instructions below and any feedback sent from inside the app will be received by me. I&amp;rsquo;m going to be working on this more over the summer, and eventually publishing it on the app store. :)
Ever since learning Spanish, it has been a dream of mine to create a vocabulary study app that meets my needs. Duolingo won&amp;rsquo;t cover advanced vocabulary, Anki requires manually-generated decks, and other apps have expensive subscription plans.</description></item><item><title>ethics drift within bubbles</title><link>https://kylrth.com/post/ethics-drift/</link><pubDate>Fri, 01 Apr 2022 08:35:54 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://kylrth.com/post/ethics-drift/</guid><description>Here are some snippets from a Lex Fridman interview with John Abramson, outspoken critic of Big Pharma.
Lex: Are people corrupt? Are people malevolent? Are people ignorant that work at the low level and at the high level, at Pfizer for example? How is this possible? I believe that most people are good, and I actually believe if you join Big Pharma your life trajectory often involves dreaming, wanting, and enjoying helping people.</description></item><item><title>notes about neuroscience</title><link>https://kylrth.com/post/neuroscience/</link><pubDate>Thu, 31 Mar 2022 10:02:44 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://kylrth.com/post/neuroscience/</guid><description>How much of brain structure is coded for in the genome? For example, the hippocampus is generally thought to be responsible for consolidating long-term memories. Is the specialization of this region an epigenetic phenomenon due to optimization in the environment, or is it coded more directly? Will we eventually see these structures emerge in artificial networks with sufficient scale and good optimization, or will we need to code it more directly?</description></item><item><title>keep your tasks in the heap</title><link>https://kylrth.com/post/tasks-stack-heap/</link><pubDate>Tue, 22 Mar 2022 11:23:20 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://kylrth.com/post/tasks-stack-heap/</guid><description>Often when someone (usually a professor) is sharing their screen I see that their browser has so many tabs open that the descriptions are lost:
That was my best impersonation as a Firefox user. Chrome will let you go a lot further (like ~113 tabs) before starting to provide a dropdown to show you the list of open tabs:
Besides the obvious fact that this makes it hard to find a tab you&amp;rsquo;re looking for, you also waste computer memory and add to your cognitive load while you&amp;rsquo;re working.</description></item><item><title>quotes from a Lex Fridman interview with Philip Goff</title><link>https://kylrth.com/post/philip-goff/</link><pubDate>Wed, 09 Mar 2022 09:39:16 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://kylrth.com/post/philip-goff/</guid><description>Here are some snippets from a Lex Fridman interview with Philip Goff, a panpsychist.
The Enlightenment ideal is to follow the evidence and the arguments where they lead, but it&amp;rsquo;s very hard for human beings to do that. I think we get stuck in some conception of how we think science ought to look. People talk about religion as a crutch, but I think a certain kind of scientism, a certain conception of how science is supposed to be, gets into people&amp;rsquo;s identity and their sense of themselves and their security.</description></item><item><title>hosting a Tor onion service</title><link>https://kylrth.com/post/tor-onion-service/</link><pubDate>Thu, 24 Feb 2022 18:28:49 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://kylrth.com/post/tor-onion-service/</guid><description>Tor onions are a way to host secure services that protect the anonymity of you and your clients.

For a lot of human history, there wasn&amp;rsquo;t so much a meaning crisis as just a food and not getting eaten by bears crisis. Once you get to a point where you can make food there was a not getting killed by other humans crisis. Sitting around wondering what it&amp;rsquo;s all about is a relatively recent luxury.</description></item><item><title>avatarify</title><link>https://kylrth.com/post/avatarify/</link><pubDate>Wed, 24 Nov 2021 11:58:34 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://kylrth.com/post/avatarify/</guid><description>Avatarify is a cool project that lets you create a relatively realistic avatar that you can use during video meetings. It works by creating a fake video input device and passing your video input through a neural network in PyTorch. My laptop doesn&amp;rsquo;t have a GPU, so I used the server/client setup.

(We call it the spaceship.) I originally got the computer so I could have a computer with a GPU for machine learning projects, but I&amp;rsquo;ve since started using this computer to host a bunch of different services. Here I&amp;rsquo;ve documented how I set up the server.

I entered Canada on August 18, 2021 by car, and my wife and daughter entered a few days later by air.

Nvidia drivers and the container runtime permalink First, check here (replacing the CUDA version in the URL with your own) to see which Nvidia drivers you need for the CUDA toolkit version you want. I&amp;rsquo;m using CUDA 11.4.2, which means I need at least driver version 470.</description></item><item><title>Minecraft in Docker</title><link>https://kylrth.com/post/minecraft/</link><pubDate>Mon, 02 Aug 2021 13:25:28 -0600</pubDate><guid>https://kylrth.com/post/minecraft/</guid><description>This guide shows how to host multiple Minecraft servers on a single machine with docker-compose.

Unfortunately, the Matrix community stopped releasing ARM images, so the latest version that will work on ARM without QEMU is v1.26.0, which is very old now. These instructions have been updated to use amd64 images, but I&amp;rsquo;ll preserve the references to ARM images as comments.</description></item><item><title>I really just want to edit and compile my LaTeX files in VS Code</title><link>https://kylrth.com/post/latex-vscode/</link><pubDate>Mon, 12 Jul 2021 21:43:47 -0600</pubDate><guid>https://kylrth.com/post/latex-vscode/</guid><description>LaTeX has a ton of different flavors, releases, and installations: MacTeX, MiKTeX, TeXworks, XeTeX, pdfTeX, LuaTeX&amp;hellip; If you&amp;rsquo;re using Linux and just want to edit LaTeX files in Visual Studio Code and have them automatically rendered as PDFs, follow these instructions:

You can use GPG to send encrypted messages, sign files to prove you generated them, and sign git commits to prove you committed them. You can get my key here. DigitalOcean has a neat guide to getting started with GPG. It explains asymmetric encryption, key generation and revocation, and key signing and maintenance.
Git commit authorship can be modified by anyone, as demonstrated by this tool. But by uploading your GPG public key to GitHub, you allow anyone who trusts GitHub to be sure that commits marked &amp;ldquo;verified&amp;rdquo; were actually created by you.</description></item><item><title>favorite art</title><link>https://kylrth.com/post/art/</link><pubDate>Sat, 03 Apr 2021 22:16:52 -0600</pubDate><guid>https://kylrth.com/post/art/</guid><description>Here&amp;rsquo;s some of my favorite art.

This meant not just removing a file but modifying commits where the keyword was added, commits where the keyword was removed, and even commits with the keyword in the commit message.

For this example, assume the keyword is &amp;ldquo;matrix&amp;rdquo;.</description></item><item><title>using Matrix</title><link>https://kylrth.com/post/matrix-registration/</link><pubDate>Sun, 02 Feb 2020 12:34:56 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://kylrth.com/post/matrix-registration/</guid><description>Matrix is a federated, open source chat system. Federation means that people can message each other across different servers, like in the image below. In that way, it works sort of like email: even though you may use you@gmail.com and I might use me@kylrth.com, we can still write each other emails.
In our case, I host the server at matrix.kylrth.com, and you and I can connect to it with various clients.</description></item></channel></rss>
