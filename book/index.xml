&lt;p>To communicate nonviolently, we need to clearly communicate our feelings, rather than our judgments. Maturity means differentiating our feelings and experiences into as many parts and distinctions as a well-trained orchestral listener. &amp;ldquo;I feel that&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;I feel when&amp;rdquo; is expressing an opinion, rather than a feeling. Even &amp;ldquo;I feel inadequate&amp;rdquo; would be better expressed as &amp;ldquo;I feel disappointed with my performance&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;I feel good about &amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo; is not specific enough.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Thinking in systems: a primer</title><link>https://kylrth.com/book/thinking-in-systems/</link><pubDate>Mon, 15 Jul 2024 11:17:09 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://kylrth.com/book/thinking-in-systems/</guid><description>&lt;p>A system is something that is composed of parts that have interrelations between them.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Each system has purposes, and those purposes may have nothing to do with stated goals. For example, if a government says it wants to protect the environment but allocates few resources to that goal, its purpose is not to protect the environment, but something else. A university may have the purpose of teaching students, while the components of the university have different goals: the student is trying to get good grades, the professor is trying to produce good research, and the administrator is trying to balance the budget.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Bowling alone: the collapse and revival of American community</title><link>https://kylrth.com/book/bowling-alone/</link><pubDate>Mon, 15 Jul 2024 10:36:57 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://kylrth.com/book/bowling-alone/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="the-trends">the trends &lt;a class="header-link" href="#the-trends">&lt;svg class="c-links__icon">&lt;title>permalink&lt;/title>&lt;use xlink:href="#icon-permalink">&lt;/use>&lt;/svg>&lt;/a>&lt;/h2>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>politics&lt;/strong>: There is now more money in politics, and less individual involvement. There are more total associations, but they look more like the AARP and Greenpeace, instead of unions, churches, bridge clubs, rotary.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>religion&lt;/strong>: Attendance has definitely gone down in the last 40 years, even if the number of people who profess stays nearly the same. (This has changed since the book was published on January 1, 2000.) The 60s and 70s saw people make their religion more private, more personal, making people less concerned with the communal support of a shared faith. Fundamentalist religion (including evangelical) results in more service and giving, but primarily within the church community. So as the mainline middle falls out, religion is becoming a less helpful societal lubricant overall, despite the fact that religiosity has generally meant more volunteerism and giving.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The whole-brain child: revolutionary strategies to nurture your child's developing mind</title><link>https://kylrth.com/book/whole-brain-child/</link><pubDate>Mon, 15 Jul 2024 10:21:23 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://kylrth.com/book/whole-brain-child/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;em>The &amp;ldquo;refrigerator sheet&amp;rdquo; found &lt;a href="https://drdansiegel.com/whole-brain-child-handouts/">here&lt;/a> has a nice summary of the 12 strategies presented in this book.&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This was a great book full of really insightful strategies to approaching mental integration. My only complaint is that they claim the strategies are neuroscientific, when in fact what they&amp;rsquo;re doing is using brain metaphors to teach real concepts. The left- and right-brain metaphor is &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lateralization_of_brain_function#Society_and_culture">taken too far&lt;/a> in popular culture, and I think this book over-emphasizes the importance of these metaphors in order to argue for the parenting strategies here. I was especially bothered by how they used the concept of &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mirror_neuron">mirror neurons&lt;/a> to argue for the sociality of the brain, as if that alone were a sufficient argument that we should teach kids to think about other people. The recommended strategies for teaching kids to see others are &amp;ldquo;enjoy each other&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;connect through conflict&amp;rdquo; which, while probably useful, do not depend on mirror neurons in any particular way.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The right side of history: how reason and moral purpose made the West great</title><link>https://kylrth.com/book/right-side-of-history/</link><pubDate>Thu, 12 Oct 2023 13:36:03 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://kylrth.com/book/right-side-of-history/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;em>The main text below is my summary of the points in the book, and I&amp;rsquo;ve put my commentary in sidenotes. If you want a Marxist, postmodern response to these ideas from the devil himself, check out&lt;/em> &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SEMB1Ky2n1E">Jordan Peterson &amp;amp; the meaning of life&lt;/a> &lt;em>by Philosophy Tube.&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Reason and moral purpose come from Athens and Jerusalem, and without those things the West would not be where it is today. Socialism means taking handouts from the nanny state, and while our society continues to function with capitalism bearing the weight of socialist programs, it&amp;rsquo;s in the process of crumbling. People on the left like to blame institutions and systems for current woes, when in reality this is the freest, most egalitarian society that has ever existed. That&amp;rsquo;s why we see the conflict over political divides strengthening in America. The West is losing its attachment to reason and moral purpose, instead shifting to intersectionality, hedonism, and scientific materialism. Happiness is built on a sense of moral purpose, and is achieved by maximizing individuals&amp;rsquo; ability to &lt;em>pursue&lt;/em> that happiness. Scientific materialism and atheism are problematic because they take away that moral purpose.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Killing sacred cows: overcoming the financial myths that are destroying your prosperity</title><link>https://kylrth.com/book/killing-sacred-cows/</link><pubDate>Thu, 12 Oct 2023 13:06:34 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://kylrth.com/book/killing-sacred-cows/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;em>This book made me cringe pretty often. I&amp;rsquo;ll leave exclamation points (!) on particularly cringe-worthy ideas, just so you can &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/metalgearobama/status/1344102150259974150?lang=en">see how based I am&lt;/a>.&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This book functions on the idea that if we accept a new set of words: poverty mindset, abundance mindset, etc, we&amp;rsquo;ll become wealthy.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Zero-sum mindset&lt;/strong>: any critique of &amp;ldquo;success&amp;rdquo;, including environmental devastation&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Scarcity/poverty mindset&lt;/strong>: saving your way to wealth, judging or being jealous of those who have things, being too safe or too risky with your money, avoiding the risk of seeking your dreams, any ideas that make you make bad decisions&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>If more people live with an abundance mindset, we will all experience less hardship.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Raising an emotionally intelligent child: the heart of parenting</title><link>https://kylrth.com/book/raising-emotionally-intelligent-child/</link><pubDate>Thu, 12 Oct 2023 12:57:20 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://kylrth.com/book/raising-emotionally-intelligent-child/</guid><description>&lt;p>Really fantastic book. Here is a quote that was extremely key for me:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Understand your base of power as a parent. By base of power, I mean the element in the parent-child relationship that makes it possible for parents to set limits on children&amp;rsquo;s misbehavior, something all kids want and need. For some parents, the base of power is threats, humiliation, or spanking. Others, who are overly permissive, may feel they have no base of power at all. For emotion coaching parents, the base of power is the emotional bond between parent and child. When you are emotionally connected to your child, limit-setting comes out of your genuine reactions to your child&amp;rsquo;s misbehavior. Your child responds to your anger, disappointment, and worries, so you don&amp;rsquo;t have to resort to negative consequences such as spanking and time-outs to amplify your feelings. The respect and affection you and your child have for each other become your primary vehicle for limit-setting.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Why we sleep: unlocking the power of sleep and dreams</title><link>https://kylrth.com/book/why-we-sleep/</link><pubDate>Wed, 11 Oct 2023 22:00:32 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://kylrth.com/book/why-we-sleep/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;em>There is &lt;a href="https://guzey.com/books/why-we-sleep/">controversy&lt;/a> around some of the claims made in this book, so I don&amp;rsquo;t take any single point of evidence extremely seriously. But the person who critiqued the book also has some weird ideas about sleep,&lt;span class="sidenote-number">&lt;small class="sidenote">For instance, he believes that we evolved in a sleep-deprived environment so sleep deprivation must be healthier for us.&lt;/small>&lt;/span>
so in the end I think I probably side with the sleep scientist for most issues except when he seems extreme. Isn&amp;rsquo;t epistemology fun?&lt;/em>&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Winners take all: the elite charade of changing the world</title><link>https://kylrth.com/book/winners-take-all/</link><pubDate>Mon, 20 Mar 2023 14:48:27 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://kylrth.com/book/winners-take-all/</guid><description>&lt;p>This book was a good one for quotable critique of modern capitalism. Here are some good ones:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>These elites believe and promote the idea that social change should be pursued principally through the free market and voluntary action, not public life and the law and the reform of the systems that people share in common; that it should be supervised by the winners of capitalism and their allies, and not be antagonistic to their needs; and that the biggest beneficiaries of the status quo should play a leading role in the status quo’s reform.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Think again: the power of knowing what you don't know</title><link>https://kylrth.com/book/think-again/</link><pubDate>Wed, 08 Mar 2023 15:08:24 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://kylrth.com/book/think-again/</guid><description>&lt;p>The book is divided into 3 parts, covering the value of rethinking, how to help others rethink, and how to help communities rethink.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="the-value-of-rethinking">the value of rethinking &lt;a class="header-link" href="#the-value-of-rethinking">&lt;svg class="c-links__icon">&lt;title>permalink&lt;/title>&lt;use xlink:href="#icon-permalink">&lt;/use>&lt;/svg>&lt;/a>&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Who you are should be a question of what you value, not what you believe.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>When people change their answers on a test, they&amp;rsquo;re far more likely to change to the right answer than a wrong answer. Rethinking is effective!&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Good families allow for healthy conflict, rather than avoiding it. Orville and Wilbur Wright fought a lot but it wasn&amp;rsquo;t relational conflict, it was task conflict. Having a good relationship with colleagues is important because it&amp;rsquo;s what keeps task conflict from bleeding into relational conflict. You need a network of people who will disagree with you. Silence disrespects the value of your views, and our ability to have civil disagreement.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Army of none: autonomous weapons and the future of war</title><link>https://kylrth.com/book/army-of-none/</link><pubDate>Tue, 14 Feb 2023 13:33:19 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://kylrth.com/book/army-of-none/</guid><description>&lt;p>The examples in this book make it clear that there is no easy line we can draw between autonomous and non-autonomous weapons (and by extension, autonomous AI agents). There is a smooth gradient of autonomy, which makes the question of allowing autonomous weapons much more nuanced. It&amp;rsquo;s probably the case that higher-level alignment becomes important proportionally to the level of autonomy and intelligence.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>He analyzes the Patriot fratricides,&lt;span class="sidenote-number">&lt;small class="sidenote">In a military context, the word &lt;em>fratricide&lt;/em> means the killing of someone on the same side of a conflict.&lt;/small>&lt;/span>
and ends up blaming the individuals involved for automation bias. I would say that these humans in the system were set up to fail by the training and the functioning of the system. They&amp;rsquo;re expected to decide whether the computer is right, with only seconds to decide. He acknowledges this later when he talks about Aegis.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Conscious: a brief guide to the fundamental mystery of the mind</title><link>https://kylrth.com/book/conscious/</link><pubDate>Mon, 13 Feb 2023 16:57:49 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://kylrth.com/book/conscious/</guid><description>&lt;p>The first thing you should know is that this book is only 2 hours long in audio form. That&amp;rsquo;s short! She managed to get into the difficult details while keeping the jargon accessible. (It helps that we literally know nothing about consciousness.)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This book argued alternately for neuroscientific, illusionist, and panpsychist theories of consciousness. It explains the hard problem of consciousness, and then later &lt;em>really&lt;/em> explains why it&amp;rsquo;s so hard. As a science-oriented person, t&amp;rsquo;s so easy to forget why it&amp;rsquo;s hard and start to explain things purely physically. When I do that, I end up thinking there&amp;rsquo;s got to be a neuroscience explanation. When I pay attention once again to my own experience, I lean towards some kind of panpsychism. The author really lays bare her own thoughts, and carefully spends time walking us through simple thought experiments to fight off the assumptions that we bring to the word &amp;ldquo;consciousness&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Being mortal: medicine and what matters in the end</title><link>https://kylrth.com/book/being-mortal/</link><pubDate>Wed, 01 Feb 2023 09:04:11 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://kylrth.com/book/being-mortal/</guid><description>&lt;p>Read this book before you turn 60. In fact, read it before you&amp;rsquo;re 40. Read it before your parents are 60. Read it if you have parents! Read it if you&amp;rsquo;re a person who is likely to die sometime in the future.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This book gave me tools for the hard decisions that exist for people in the last decade(s) of their lives. Before reaching this stage of life ourselves, we don&amp;rsquo;t think about it much because we&amp;rsquo;ve tended to separate the aged from our communities. We&amp;rsquo;ve lost a cultural understanding of what a good death looks like. This book brings that knowledge back to a world with modern medicine.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The big three in economics: Adam Smith, Karl Marx, and John Maynard Keynes</title><link>https://kylrth.com/book/big-three-economics/</link><pubDate>Tue, 24 Jan 2023 13:28:01 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://kylrth.com/book/big-three-economics/</guid><description>&lt;p>This book was published in 2007, before the Great Recession. It definitely reads that way. Very capitalist, very Christian, very neo-liberal.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I enjoyed learning more about Adam Smith. I feel like Skousen does a good job painting the importance of his ideas as an invention that drove the Industrial Revolution.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>According to Skousen, Marx is the devil incarnate, and his ideas are a dangerous disease infecting the minds of intellectuals and workers. Skousen takes a strange interest in painting Marx and Keynes as deranged, sexual deviants, etc. (&amp;ldquo;The Truth about Keynes&amp;rsquo; Homosexuality&amp;rdquo; is a section in this book.)&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The drunkard's walk: how randomness rules our lives</title><link>https://kylrth.com/book/drunkards-walk/</link><pubDate>Tue, 24 Jan 2023 13:23:22 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://kylrth.com/book/drunkards-walk/</guid><description>&lt;p>This is a good intro for non-statisticians to avoid some common pitfalls and misconceptions that the public often has. It&amp;rsquo;ll help you understand what it means when something is statistically significant, why sometimes studies contradict each other, and how to avoid believing in patterns that don&amp;rsquo;t exist. You&amp;rsquo;ll understand the following biases and fallacies:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>confirmation bias&lt;/li>
&lt;li>gambler&amp;rsquo;s fallacy&lt;/li>
&lt;li>hot hand fallacy&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&amp;ldquo;hindsight is 20/20&amp;rdquo;: the illusion of hindsight for explaining historical performance/events&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>One mistake I want to point out:&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The birth order book: why you are the way you are</title><link>https://kylrth.com/book/birth-order/</link><pubDate>Thu, 01 Dec 2022 09:48:05 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://kylrth.com/book/birth-order/</guid><description>&lt;p>This book really gave me the chance to think about what being the firstborn did to my personality and my life outlook. I think it&amp;rsquo;s pretty clear I fit the mold of a perfectionist firstborn, thanks to having usually met the high expectations of my parents growing up. It&amp;rsquo;s been especially valuable to think about how that will affect my own parenting, especially toward my first child. I think one of the most useful things about the book is that it prepares a parent to try to mediate some of the negative consequences of birth order. Here are the main tasks for a parent for each category:&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Educated</title><link>https://kylrth.com/book/educated/</link><pubDate>Thu, 17 Feb 2022 09:51:11 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://kylrth.com/book/educated/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="thinking-for-yourself">thinking for yourself &lt;a class="header-link" href="#thinking-for-yourself">&lt;svg class="c-links__icon">&lt;title>permalink&lt;/title>&lt;use xlink:href="#icon-permalink">&lt;/use>&lt;/svg>&lt;/a>&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>I recognized myself a little in this book, not in the events, severity, or locations but in the path to being &amp;ldquo;educated&amp;rdquo; in the sense that Westover intends. I&amp;rsquo;ll try to convey what that sense is with some quotes from the book.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The first moment is after she takes a class on American history at BYU. She returns home and gets her face dirty while working, and her brother calls her a N&amp;mdash;r, a joke he had made many times before.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Cratylus</title><link>https://kylrth.com/book/cratylus/</link><pubDate>Sun, 16 Jan 2022 15:11:14 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://kylrth.com/book/cratylus/</guid><description>&lt;p>In this dialog Hermogenes comes to Socrates to discuss Cratylus&amp;rsquo; view of the nature of names, whether they are true to the objects they represent or are just conventional. Hermogenes believes that names are purely conventional, while Cratylus believes the opposite. Socrates falls somewhere in the middle:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>I quite agree with you that words should as far as possible resemble things; but I fear that this dragging in of resemblance, as Hermogenes says, is a shabby thing, which has to be supplemented by the mechanical aid of convention with a view to correctness; for I believe that if we could always, or almost always, use likenesses, which are perfectly appropriate, this would be the most perfect state of language; as the opposite is the most imperfect.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Crito</title><link>https://kylrth.com/book/crito/</link><pubDate>Mon, 27 Dec 2021 14:05:02 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://kylrth.com/book/crito/</guid><description>&lt;p>In this dialogue Crito comes to Socrates who is in prison waiting to be executed by the state. Crito has come to convince Socrates to come and escape with him. Crito&amp;rsquo;s escape plan will not cause great inconvenience for any of Socrates&amp;rsquo; friends, and he would be able to live well in Thessaly. Socrates ends up convincing Crito that it would be wrong for him to escape.&lt;/p>

Socrates is often considered a founder of Western philosophy, and it was easy for me to see in the text some common philosophical themes I&amp;rsquo;ve been exposed to growing up in the West.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="the-fear-of-death-is-irrational">the fear of death is irrational &lt;a class="header-link" href="#the-fear-of-death-is-irrational">&lt;svg class="c-links__icon">&lt;title>permalink&lt;/title>&lt;use xlink:href="#icon-permalink">&lt;/use>&lt;/svg>&lt;/a>&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Socrates argues that the fear of death is irrational from two perspectives: one, that what happens after death cannot be bad; and two, that a righteous person needs to be more concerned with whether he is doing right or wrong than whether death occurs or not. You can see the first one here:&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The last speakers: the quest to save the world's most endangered languages</title><link>https://kylrth.com/book/last-speakers/</link><pubDate>Mon, 31 May 2021 08:29:00 -0600</pubDate><guid>https://kylrth.com/book/last-speakers/</guid><description>&lt;p>This book argues that language loss is always bad, but that we can do something to save it. While the stories in the book leave me feeling like every language lost is a terrible cost, I think it&amp;rsquo;s inevitable as our species merges into a global society due to technology. I think we ought to prioritize the proper treatment and respect of marginalized and alternative cultures, including their languages and how these cultures want to maintain them. But there is a cost to stopping &lt;em>all&lt;/em> language loss that is just not worth it once a language has been documented for research purposes.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The seven principles for making marriage work: a practical guide from the country's foremost relationship expert</title><link>https://kylrth.com/book/seven-principles-for-marriage/</link><pubDate>Wed, 26 May 2021 06:52:44 -0600</pubDate><guid>https://kylrth.com/book/seven-principles-for-marriage/</guid><description>&lt;p>Better communication doesn&amp;rsquo;t really solve marriage problems. It has a low success rate, and that makes sense because there are plenty of marriages that yell and dispute. Disputation is not a sign of an unhealthy marriage. You&amp;rsquo;d have to be really magnanimous to take criticism about you, even if presented as softly as possible.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Personality does not make a marriage incompatible. People can be friends but have very distinct personalities.

&lt;p>In chapter 7 Harry introduces Draco to the beauty of scientific advancement, and it actually moved me to tears. You should read the &lt;a href="https://www.hpmor.com/chapter/7">whole thing&lt;/a>, but here are some of the best quotes:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;Anyway,&amp;rdquo; Harry said, &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m saying that you don&amp;rsquo;t seem to have been paying much attention to what goes on in the Muggle world.&amp;rdquo; Probably because the whole wizarding world seemed to regard the rest of Earth as a slum, deserving around as much news coverage as the Financial Times awarded to the routine agonies of Burundi. &amp;ldquo;All right.

&lt;p>Richard Bushman categorizes those who leave the church into two broad categories: those who feel &amp;ldquo;switched off&amp;rdquo;, and those who feel &amp;ldquo;squeezed out&amp;rdquo;. Mason summarizes the switched-off group as those who encounter troubling information about church history or doctrine, and as they discover more information they become jaded by it until they can no longer see the good the church does for them or for others.

It was super fortunate that my wife and I listened to it together on a road trip, and became equally enthralled with the idea of dumping all of our excess clutter.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>We have excess clutter because of a fundamental problem with the way we deal with possessions. This is difficult to solve with simple tricks like better organization or getting rid of one thing every day. She argues that the best way to overcome the clutter is by doing a one-time hardcore purge of the entire house. She spends a long time detailing what she calls the KonMari Method (which you can read about on her &lt;a href="https://konmari.com/what-is-konmari-method/">website&lt;/a>). For us, doing this initial purge took us about two weeks. We spent several hours each evening, plus all day on both Saturdays. All told I think we got rid of like 15 garbage bags-worth of things from our two-bedroom apartment.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The smartest kids in the world</title><link>https://kylrth.com/book/smartest-kids/</link><pubDate>Tue, 30 Mar 2021 07:00:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://kylrth.com/book/smartest-kids/</guid><description>&lt;p>The PISA test tests common senses reasoning. The countries that did best on the test were a surprise to everyone. Finland, South Korea, and Poland were all standouts in their own ways, and Ripley compares the policies and learning environments in these countries with those of the US to determine why the US is falling behind, especially in math and science.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We talk a lot about parent involvement in the US, but the US actually has above average parental involvement. It turns out it&amp;rsquo;s not very correlated with success. Parent involvement is most useful when it&amp;rsquo;s reading to your child every day or asking them deep questions about school and about their opinions of broader issues. In the US we have lots of superintendents over small school districts, so there&amp;rsquo;s a lot of overhead without much benefit. We&amp;rsquo;re also afraid of standardization, so each school district has to sort of reinvent the wheel when it comes to curricula and standards. Common Core is an attempt by state education departments to agree to standards together so that textbooks and schools can target their products and training toward a common, well-defined set of goals.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The infinite Atonement</title><link>https://kylrth.com/book/infinite-atonement/</link><pubDate>Tue, 30 Mar 2021 06:30:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://kylrth.com/book/infinite-atonement/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;em>These notes are made while reading this with a Mormon theological background, so I skip noting some of the basic Mormon doctrines about the Atonement that he teaches.&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The Atonement is the central doctrine of Christianity. All scripture should be at least partially focused on it, and we&amp;rsquo;re invited to &amp;ldquo;speak of the atonement of Christ, and attain to a perfect knowledge of him&amp;rdquo; (Jacob 4:12).&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Just like everything else, capitalism has screwed over our diets by giving companies the incentive to put shareholders above customers. Food companies employ lobbyists to keep subsidies on sugar/corn syrup/meat, and keep a stranglehold on public organizations. They buy billions of dollars of ads to communicate the message that it&amp;rsquo;s laziness that has caused the obesity epidemic and to push their products that appeal to the unconscious desires of our brains to produce artificial hunger.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The gene: an intimate history</title><link>https://kylrth.com/book/the-gene/</link><pubDate>Fri, 22 Jan 2021 06:14:58 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://kylrth.com/book/the-gene/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;em>These are notes I made after finishing the book, so they&amp;rsquo;ll be more heavily weighted toward concepts discussed near the end.

&lt;p>It seems like our identity derives from a complicated combination of genes and chance environmental effects. Part of our strength as a species has been our natural variation, and to begin editing the genome is to assume that we can do it better than evolution has done up until this point. To choose to remove variations is to decide that normal is best. (Some of our most beautiful productions have been created by people who under our normal social environment would be considered mentally ill.) To remove variation or introduce variation thus has a literally existential effect on our identity. What does it mean for a process to understand its own instructions?&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Faith is not blind</title><link>https://kylrth.com/book/faith-is-not-blind/</link><pubDate>Mon, 18 Jan 2021 08:11:23 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://kylrth.com/book/faith-is-not-blind/</guid><description>&lt;p>Elder Hafen struggled as a missionary with the concept of knowing versus believing: he felt he believed it was true, but not that he knew it. On the mission he felt pressure to bear testimony with the word &amp;ldquo;know&amp;rdquo;, but he chafed at that. In this book, Elder Hafen hopes to discuss the complex boundaries between believing and knowing, Richard Bushman, a prominent LDS historian, found himself in a similar situation. He felt that he didn&amp;rsquo;t have the right words to express his belief in the nuanced way that he needed, even though looking back he thinks he &lt;em>did&lt;/em> believe. This makes me look forward to reading Bushman&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;Rough Stone Rolling&amp;rdquo;, to try to understand his language of faith.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Tools and weapons: the promise and peril of the digital age</title><link>https://kylrth.com/book/tools-and-weapons/</link><pubDate>Thu, 03 Dec 2020 20:58:02 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://kylrth.com/book/tools-and-weapons/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;em>I started taking notes later in the book.

This has been proven in lots of experiments where people have been given subconscious cues to help them solve problems, but the people are unaware of this and make up answers when asked to explain how they came to conclusions. It&amp;rsquo;s important to trust these judgments that seem to come out of nowhere, but if we try to explain them we&amp;rsquo;ll start trying to provide rational answers, which can be totally false or misleading. (Think about when one of the jurors in the OJ Simpson trial said that race had absolutely nothing to do with their judgment.)&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>A short history of nearly everything</title><link>https://kylrth.com/book/short-history-nearly-everything/</link><pubDate>Wed, 07 Oct 2020 11:19:03 -0600</pubDate><guid>https://kylrth.com/book/short-history-nearly-everything/</guid><description>&lt;p>We are &lt;em>extremely&lt;/em> lucky to be here, and even more lucky to be able to appreciate it.

She said some important things about stigma in society. She talked specifically about the stigma of not talking about birth control, but she made general statements too.

&lt;li>An important question is how much we need to fight income inequality. Is it fair to have 35% growth in the upper class and 3% growth in the lower class? Where is a good balance?&lt;/li>
&lt;li>We have grown a lot richer since the Industrial Revolution, because we&amp;rsquo;ve become more productive.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Wealth is not a zero-sum game. Globalization is good because it allows us to buy cheaper, better products.
We can offset short-run job loss by paying or giving human capital to those who lose their jobs to globalization&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Policies often don&amp;rsquo;t do what we intend them to do, because they change people&amp;rsquo;s decisions for the involved choice. Often, the best way to do policy is to incentivize the appropriate decision.
E.g. Tax the purchase of inefficient cars on a scale, so car makers want to produce cheaper efficient cars to compete.
Do that instead of simply banning cars with 18 mpg or less.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The Fed&amp;rsquo;s job is to control the availability of credit through setting their interest rates, so banks who borrow from them can adjust their interest rates accordingly. It&amp;rsquo;s really hard with so many factors, but Bernanke et. al. did an outstanding job.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Things that help an economy or nation develop:
effective government institutionsproperty rightsno excessive regulationhuman capitalgeography (countries between the tropics have more diseases and less productive crops)openness to traderesponsible fiscal and monetary policy(natural resources don&amp;rsquo;t matter)democracypeaceinclusion of women in economic production&lt;/li>
&lt;li>We can help underdeveloped countries, but the question of how is complicated.
Certainly, we should open our borders to their products.Jeffrey Sachs &amp;ndash; all these countries need is capital, so developed countries should invest in them (e.g. through comprehensively fighting AIDS)William Easterly &amp;ndash; We can&amp;rsquo;t measure effectiveness based on inputs. That&amp;rsquo;s like rating Hollywood movies by budget size. &amp;ldquo;Instead we should do small, context-sensitive projects with measurable benefits.&amp;ldquo;But most of the developing world&amp;rsquo;s problems come from bad government policy.&lt;/li>

&lt;p>Descartes&amp;rsquo; approach wasn&amp;rsquo;t as good as Newton&amp;rsquo;s. Descartes relied on the soundness of his own reasoning.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;The erroneous conception that revelation ended with the apostles promotes the misconception among sectarian religions that the Gospel is complete and that with a liberal admixture of human wisdom, all will be crystal clear.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>

&lt;p>In fact, I saw all kinds of parallels between finance and Big Data. Both industries gobble up the same pool of talent, much of it from elite universities like MIT, Princeton, or Stanford. These new hires are ravenous for success and have been focused on external metrics&amp;ndash;like SAT scores and college admissions&amp;ndash;their entire lives. Whether in finance or tech, the message they&amp;rsquo;ve received is that they will be rich, that they will run the world. Their productivity indicates that they&amp;rsquo;re on the right track, and it translates into dollars. This leads to the fallacious conclusion that whatever they&amp;rsquo;re doing to bring in more money is good. It &amp;ldquo;adds value.&amp;rdquo; Otherwise, why would the market reward it?&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Essentialism</title><link>https://kylrth.com/book/essentialism/</link><pubDate>Sun, 23 Aug 2020 07:47:12 -0600</pubDate><guid>https://kylrth.com/book/essentialism/</guid><description>&lt;p>The main character of the first story slowly changed his attitude toward demands on his resources.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&amp;ldquo;Can I actually fulfill this request, given the time and resources I have?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&amp;ldquo;Is this the very most important thing I should be doing with my time and resources right now?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&amp;ldquo;Just because I was invited didn&amp;rsquo;t seem a good enough reason to attend.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s important to pursue &amp;ldquo;less but better&amp;rdquo; in a disciplined way. Simply doing fewer things is not meaningful. Most things in the world are trivial noise, and my job is to sift through noise and find things that are truly valuable. This involves active consideration of responsibilities and trade-offs involved in making a choice. I think I often try to &amp;ldquo;force execution at the last moment&amp;rdquo;, which is a mark of a non-essentialist.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Increase in learning: spiritual patterns for obtaining your own answers</title><link>https://kylrth.com/book/increase-in-learning/</link><pubDate>Wed, 20 Nov 2019 10:14:43 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://kylrth.com/book/increase-in-learning/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="chapter-1">Chapter 1 &lt;a class="header-link" href="#chapter-1">&lt;svg class="c-links__icon">&lt;title>permalink&lt;/title>&lt;use xlink:href="#icon-permalink">&lt;/use>&lt;/svg>&lt;/a>&lt;/h2>
