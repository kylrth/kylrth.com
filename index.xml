Before the industrial revolution, humans could essentially understand what a thing did by looking at it, and ownership was about possession of the object. Now we don&amp;rsquo;t understand our tools, and so possession does not imply control.</description></item><item><title>"Low-resource" text classification: a parameter-free classification method with compressors</title><link>https://kylrth.com/paper/gzip-text-classification/</link><pubDate>Mon, 24 Jul 2023 11:35:13 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://kylrth.com/paper/gzip-text-classification/</guid><description>I presented this paper in Bang Liu&amp;rsquo;s research group meeting on 2023-07-24.

In the information age, we like to see everything as computation. But what do we mean when we say that something is computation? We mean that a physical system with predictable interactions has a meaningful result.

The main result of the paper is that when this is combined with item-specific prompt retrieval the performance drastically improves (&amp;gt;10% relative gain and lower performance variance). Interestingly, selective annotation does not help for finetuning, or when the prompts are randomly selected. They call their selective annotation method &amp;ldquo;vote-\(k\)&amp;rdquo;.
selective annotation method permalink Vote-\(k\) essentially creates a network of similaraccording to Sentence-BERT unlabeled instances, and then selects from them with a network importance score that is discounted to promote diversityThe discounting is performed by iteratively adding to the selection set, each time penalizing new nodes for being close to nodes that are already in the selection set.</description></item><item><title>Trivial or impossible—dichotomous data difficulty masks model differences (on ImageNet and beyond)</title><link>https://kylrth.com/paper/dichotomous-data-difficulty/</link><pubDate>Mon, 15 Aug 2022 14:21:56 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://kylrth.com/paper/dichotomous-data-difficulty/</guid><description>We observe that 48.2% [of] images [in ImageNet] are learned by all models regardless of their inductive bias; 14.3% [of] images are consistently misclassified by all models; only roughly a third (37.5%) of images are responsible for the differences between two models&amp;rsquo; decisions.

This beats power law scaling in a big way. There is still no free lunch, in some sense, because in most cases it will become progressively harder to add new useful samples as the dataset gets bigger. But this is a big deal for computation, because it means that the number of samples in the dataset is not nearly as important as the coverage and quality that the dataset provides.</description></item><item><title>LocoProp: enhancing backprop via local loss optimization</title><link>https://kylrth.com/paper/locoprop/</link><pubDate>Fri, 05 Aug 2022 09:52:06 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://kylrth.com/paper/locoprop/</guid><description>This was a paper I presented about in Bang Liu&amp;rsquo;s research group meeting on 2022-08-05.

People talk about religion as a crutch, but I think a certain kind of scientism, a certain conception of how science is supposed to be, gets into people&amp;rsquo;s identity and their sense of themselves and their security.</description></item><item><title>hosting a Tor onion service</title><link>https://kylrth.com/post/tor-onion-service/</link><pubDate>Thu, 24 Feb 2022 18:28:49 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://kylrth.com/post/tor-onion-service/</guid><description>Tor onions are a way to host secure services that protect the anonymity of you and your clients.

The interesting result is that the exponents of these three approaches were substantially different (see Table 1 in the paper), which says to me that the few-shot inference approach matters a lot.
The surprising result was that while more training on the &amp;ldquo;non-natural&amp;rdquo; Omniglot dataset did not improve few-shot accuracy on other datasets, training on &amp;ldquo;natural&amp;rdquo; datasets did improve accuracy on few-shot Omniglot.</description></item><item><title>Learning explanations that are hard to vary</title><link>https://kylrth.com/paper/learning-explanations-hard-to-vary/</link><pubDate>Tue, 22 Feb 2022 12:29:17 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://kylrth.com/paper/learning-explanations-hard-to-vary/</guid><description>The big idea here is to use the geometric mean instead of the arithmetic mean across samples in the batch when computing the gradient for SGD. This overcomes the situation where averaging produces optima that are not actually optimal for any individual samples, as demonstrated in their toy example below:

Our main hypothesis is that deep learning succeeded in part because of a set of inductive biases, but that additional ones should be added in order to go from good in-distribution generalization in highly supervised learning tasks (or where strong and dense rewards are available), such as object recognition in images, to strong out-of-distribution generalization and transfer learning to new tasks with low sample complexity.</description></item><item><title>SpanBERT: improving pre-training by representing and predicting spans</title><link>https://kylrth.com/paper/spanbert/</link><pubDate>Sat, 05 Dec 2020 16:08:03 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://kylrth.com/paper/spanbert/</guid><description>BERT optimizes the Masked Language Model (MLM) objective by masking word pieces uniformly at random in its training data and attempting to predict the masked values. With SpanBERT, spans of tokens are masked and the model is expected to predict the text in the spans from the representations of the words on the boundary. Span lengths follow a geometric distribution, and span start points are uniformly random.
To predict each individual masked token, a two-layer feedforward network was provided with the boundary token representations plus the position embedding of the target token, and the output vector representation was used to predict the masked token and compute cross-entropy loss exactly as in standard MLM.</description></item><item><title>Tools and weapons: the promise and peril of the digital age</title><link>https://kylrth.com/book/tools-and-weapons/</link><pubDate>Thu, 03 Dec 2020 20:58:02 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://kylrth.com/book/tools-and-weapons/</guid><description>I started taking notes later in the book.

Specifically, ELMo representations are a learned linear combination of all layers of an LSTM encoding. The LSTM undergoes general semi-supervised pretraining, but the linear combination is learned specific to the task.</description></item><item><title>Removing a keyword from git history</title><link>https://kylrth.com/post/removing-keyword-from-git-history/</link><pubDate>Wed, 02 Dec 2020 11:34:25 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://kylrth.com/post/removing-keyword-from-git-history/</guid><description>I recently had to remove a keyword from the git history of a project I was working on.

Underfitting can be observed with a small learning rate, simple architecture, or complex data distribution.
