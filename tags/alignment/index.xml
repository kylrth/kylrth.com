There is a smooth gradient of autonomy, which makes the question of allowing autonomous weapons much more nuanced. It&amp;rsquo;s probably the case that higher-level alignment becomes important proportionally to the level of autonomy and intelligence.

Behind each vision for ethically-aligned AI sits a deeper question. How are we to decide which principles or objectives to encode in AI—and who has the right to make these decisions—given that we live in a pluralistic world that is full of competing conceptions of value?</description></item><item><title>Unsolved problems in ML safety</title><link>https://kylrth.com/paper/unsolved-problems-ml-safety/</link><pubDate>Mon, 06 Feb 2023 11:39:33 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://kylrth.com/paper/unsolved-problems-ml-safety/</guid><description>This was a paper we presented about in Irina Rish&amp;rsquo;s neural scaling laws course (IFT6760A) in winter 2023.
