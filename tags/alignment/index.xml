There were news articles in French (Le Devoir), but not as many in English unfortunately (Datanami).
Bengio: What motivates you to do what you do? This topic has turned from an academic move to a societal one really quickly, and it&amp;rsquo;s scary.</description></item><item><title>Army of none: autonomous weapons and the future of war</title><link>https://kylrth.com/book/army-of-none/</link><pubDate>Tue, 14 Feb 2023 13:33:19 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://kylrth.com/book/army-of-none/</guid><description>The examples in this book make it clear that there is no easy line we can draw between autonomous and non-autonomous weapons (and by extension, autonomous AI agents). There is a smooth gradient of autonomy, which makes the question of allowing autonomous weapons much more nuanced. It&amp;rsquo;s probably the case that higher-level alignment becomes important proportionally to the level of autonomy and intelligence.
He analyzes the Patriot fratricides,In a military context, the word fratricide means the killing of someone on the same side of a conflict.</description></item><item><title>Artificial intelligence, values, and alignment</title><link>https://kylrth.com/paper/ai-values-alignment/</link><pubDate>Fri, 10 Feb 2023 08:09:15 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://kylrth.com/paper/ai-values-alignment/</guid><description>I presented this paper in Bang Liu&amp;rsquo;s research group meeting in two installments on 2023-02-20 and 2023-02-27, and also in Irina Rish&amp;rsquo;s scaling and alignment course (IFT6760A) on 2023-03-07.

Behind each vision for ethically-aligned AI sits a deeper question. How are we to decide which principles or objectives to encode in AI—and who has the right to make these decisions—given that we live in a pluralistic world that is full of competing conceptions of value?</description></item><item><title>Unsolved problems in ML safety</title><link>https://kylrth.com/paper/unsolved-problems-ml-safety/</link><pubDate>Mon, 06 Feb 2023 11:39:33 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://kylrth.com/paper/unsolved-problems-ml-safety/</guid><description>This was a paper we presented about in Irina Rish&amp;rsquo;s neural scaling laws course (IFT6760A) in winter 2023.
