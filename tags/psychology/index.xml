When knowledge is new, it sometimes only comes back to me when I&amp;rsquo;m in the right context. For example, right now I can only think vaguely of how to adjust a chain derailleur on a bike, but I know that if I walked up to my bike and looked closely at the derailleur some more knowledge would appear.</description></item></channel></rss>
