Duolingo won&amp;rsquo;t cover advanced vocabulary, Anki requires manually-generated decks, and other apps have expensive subscription plans.</description></item><item><title>Jupyter Lab Hub in Docker with Nvidia GPU support</title><link>https://kylrth.com/post/jupyter-lab/</link><pubDate>Tue, 19 Oct 2021 20:28:25 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://kylrth.com/post/jupyter-lab/</guid><description>This is how I set up my headless home server with a Jupyter Lab Docker container with an Nvidia GPU runtime. Login is handled by a GitHub OAuth application.
Nvidia drivers and the container runtime First, check here (replacing the CUDA version in the URL with your own) to see which Nvidia drivers you need for the CUDA toolkit version you want. I&amp;rsquo;m using CUDA 11.4.2, which means I need at least driver version 470.</description></item></channel></rss>
