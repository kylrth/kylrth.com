The structure of the post follows the structure of the assignment: summarization followed by my own comments.
To summarize, the authors create a unifying framework for describing message-passing neural networks, which they apply to the problem of predicting the structural properties of chemical compounds in the QM9 dataset.
paper summarization The authors first demonstrate that many of the recent works applying neural nets to this problem can fit into a message-passing neural network (MPNN) framework.</description></item></channel></rss>
