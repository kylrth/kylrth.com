These notes will hopefully be full of good (and bad) ideas, so if someone happens to borrow the right idea and publish on it then I&amp;rsquo;ll be happy to have a new collaborator for the future.
This post contains my research notes as I try to understand how model scaling affects worst-group performance.</description></item></channel></rss>
