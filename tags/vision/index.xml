The post contains no summarization, only questions and thoughts.
In this paper they mention that the mask vector is learned, and it sounds like the positional embeddings are also learned. I remember in Attention is all you need they found that cosine positional embeddings worked better than learned ones, especially for sequences of longer length.</description></item></channel></rss>
