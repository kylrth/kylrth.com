Richard Bushman categorizes those who leave the church into two broad categories: those who feel &amp;ldquo;switched off&amp;rdquo;, and those who feel &amp;ldquo;squeezed out&amp;rdquo;. Mason summarizes the switched-off group as those who encounter troubling information about church history or doctrine, and as they discover more information they become jaded by it until they can no longer see the good the church does for them or for others.</description></item><item><title>The smartest kids in the world</title><link>https://kylrth.com/book/smartest-kids/</link><pubDate>Tue, 30 Mar 2021 07:00:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://kylrth.com/book/smartest-kids/</guid><description>The PISA test tests common senses reasoning. The countries that did best on the test were a surprise to everyone. Finland, South Korea, and Poland were all standouts in their own ways, and Ripley compares the policies and learning environments in these countries with those of the US to determine why the US is falling behind, especially in math and science.
We talk a lot about parent involvement in the US, but the US actually has above average parental involvement.</description></item><item><title>The gene: an intimate history</title><link>https://kylrth.com/book/the-gene/</link><pubDate>Fri, 22 Jan 2021 06:14:58 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://kylrth.com/book/the-gene/</guid><description>These are notes I made after finishing the book, so they&amp;rsquo;ll be more heavily weighted toward concepts discussed near the end. The first half of the book was primarily dedicated to a history of genetic research, which I think helped the reader understand the issues discussed in the latter half.
playing God permalink It seems like our identity derives from a complicated combination of genes and chance environmental effects. Part of our strength as a species has been our natural variation, and to begin editing the genome is to assume that we can do it better than evolution has done up until this point.</description></item><item><title>Tools and weapons: the promise and peril of the digital age</title><link>https://kylrth.com/book/tools-and-weapons/</link><pubDate>Thu, 03 Dec 2020 20:58:02 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://kylrth.com/book/tools-and-weapons/</guid><description>I started taking notes later in the book. There were lots of good insights in the first half. Sorry!
broadband access permalink Getting the internet to rural communities is a big deal for the rural economy. Just like electricity, it&amp;rsquo;s something that needs government support because there isn&amp;rsquo;t the economic incentive for ISPs to reach some of these locations.
ethical AI permalink The focus on AI now is not just a fad, but a convergence of several trends that have made AI the next logical step: the increased computational resources, flexible access to compute through the cloud, etc.</description></item><item><title>Blink: the power of thinking without thinking</title><link>https://kylrth.com/book/blink/</link><pubDate>Tue, 17 Nov 2020 20:44:48 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://kylrth.com/book/blink/</guid><description>Our subconscious not only manages bodily systems but also performs processing of features in our experience that our conscious does not have time to process. This has been proven in lots of experiments where people have been given subconscious cues to help them solve problems, but the people are unaware of this and make up answers when asked to explain how they came to conclusions. It&amp;rsquo;s important to trust these judgments that seem to come out of nowhere, but if we try to explain them we&amp;rsquo;ll start trying to provide rational answers, which can be totally false or misleading.</description></item><item><title>A short history of nearly everything</title><link>https://kylrth.com/book/short-history-nearly-everything/</link><pubDate>Wed, 07 Oct 2020 11:19:03 -0600</pubDate><guid>https://kylrth.com/book/short-history-nearly-everything/</guid><description>We are extremely lucky to be here, and even more lucky to be able to appreciate it. Let&amp;rsquo;s not waste it.</description></item><item><title>The moment of lift: how empowering women changes the world</title><link>https://kylrth.com/book/moment-of-lift/</link><pubDate>Tue, 01 Sep 2020 05:25:38 -0600</pubDate><guid>https://kylrth.com/book/moment-of-lift/</guid><description>This book is about empowering women by giving them the freedom to make their own choices and speak for themselves. She said some important things about stigma in society. She talked specifically about the stigma of not talking about birth control, but she made general statements too. It&amp;rsquo;s each person&amp;rsquo;s responsibility to work against stigma and stop the human tendency to cast out others. I need to spend more time thinking about my own stigmas and biases, so that I can help those who are marginalized.</description></item><item><title>Weapons of math destruction: how big data increases inequality and threatens democracy</title><link>https://kylrth.com/book/weapons-of-math-destruction/</link><pubDate>Sun, 30 Aug 2020 06:46:49 -0600</pubDate><guid>https://kylrth.com/book/weapons-of-math-destruction/</guid><description>In fact, I saw all kinds of parallels between finance and Big Data. Both industries gobble up the same pool of talent, much of it from elite universities like MIT, Princeton, or Stanford. These new hires are ravenous for success and have been focused on external metrics&amp;ndash;like SAT scores and college admissions&amp;ndash;their entire lives. Whether in finance or tech, the message they&amp;rsquo;ve received is that they will be rich, that they will run the world.</description></item></channel></rss>
