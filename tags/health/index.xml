But the person who critiqued the book also has some weird ideas about sleep,For instance, he believes that we evolved in a sleep-deprived environment so sleep deprivation must be healthier for us. so in the end I think I probably side with the sleep scientist for most issues except when he seems extreme.</description></item><item><title>Being mortal: medicine and what matters in the end</title><link>https://kylrth.com/book/being-mortal/</link><pubDate>Wed, 01 Feb 2023 09:04:11 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://kylrth.com/book/being-mortal/</guid><description>Read this book before you turn 60. In fact, read it before you&amp;rsquo;re 40. Read it before your parents are 60. Read it if you have parents! Read it if you&amp;rsquo;re a person who is likely to die sometime in the future.
This book gave me tools for the hard decisions that exist for people in the last decade(s) of their lives. Before reaching this stage of life ourselves, we don&amp;rsquo;t think about it much because we&amp;rsquo;ve tended to separate the aged from our communities.</description></item><item><title>How not to diet: the groundbreaking science of healthy, permanent weight loss</title><link>https://kylrth.com/book/how-not-to-diet/</link><pubDate>Wed, 03 Mar 2021 07:00:37 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://kylrth.com/book/how-not-to-diet/</guid><description>I read this book with Irresistible and the Social Dilemma on my mind, so I have a lot of notes here about addiction and big business.
Just like everything else, capitalism has screwed over our diets by giving companies the incentive to put shareholders above customers. Food companies employ lobbyists to keep subsidies on sugar/corn syrup/meat, and keep a stranglehold on public organizations. They buy billions of dollars of ads to communicate the message that it&amp;rsquo;s laziness that has caused the obesity epidemic and to push their products that appeal to the unconscious desires of our brains to produce artificial hunger.</description></item></channel></rss>
