I&amp;rsquo;ll leave exclamation points (!) on particularly cringe-worthy ideas, just so you can see how based I am.
This book functions on the idea that if we accept a new set of words: poverty mindset, abundance mindset, etc, we&amp;rsquo;ll become wealthy.
Zero-sum mindset: any critique of &amp;ldquo;success&amp;rdquo;, including environmental devastation Scarcity/poverty mindset: saving your way to wealth, judging or being jealous of those who have things, being too safe or too risky with your money, avoiding the risk of seeking your dreams, any ideas that make you make bad decisions If more people live with an abundance mindset, we will all experience less hardship.</description></item></channel></rss>
