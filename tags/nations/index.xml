Is it fair to have 35% growth in the upper class and 3% growth in the lower class? Where is a good balance? We have grown a lot richer since the Industrial Revolution, because we&amp;rsquo;ve become more productive. Wealth is not a zero-sum game. Globalization is good because it allows us to buy cheaper, better products. We can offset short-run job loss by paying or giving human capital to those who lose their jobs to globalization Policies often don&amp;rsquo;t do what we intend them to do, because they change people&amp;rsquo;s decisions for the involved choice.</description></item></channel></rss>
