Unfortunately, the Matrix community has stopped releasing ARM images, so the latest version that will work on ARM is v1.26.0. These instructions will work the same for x86_64 systems, except you&amp;rsquo;ll be able to use the default x86_64 images in the docker-compose file.
This installation comes with Maubot and matrix-registration containers too. If you don&amp;rsquo;t want to use those features, leave out those sections of the docker-compose config and don&amp;rsquo;t follow the instructions in the corresponding sections.</description></item><item><title>using Matrix</title><link>https://kylrth.com/post/matrix-registration/</link><pubDate>Sun, 02 Feb 2020 12:34:56 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://kylrth.com/post/matrix-registration/</guid><description>Matrix is a federated, open source chat system. By federated, we mean that people can communicate across different servers, like in the image below. In that way, it works sort of like email: even though you may use you@gmail.com and I might use me@kylrth.com, we can still write each other emails.
In our case, I host the server at matrix.kylrth.com, and you and I can connect to it with various clients.</description></item></channel></rss>
